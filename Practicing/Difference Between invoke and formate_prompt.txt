The difference between prompt.invoke() and prompt.format_prompt() is significant and relates to what stage of processing you're at 
with your prompt. Let's break down each method:

prompt.format_prompt():

format_prompt() creates a PromptValue object. This object contains the formatted prompt, but it hasn't been sent to any language model yet. 
It's useful when you want to inspect the prompt before sending it to a model, or if you need to use the prompt in a different context.

prompt.invoke():

invoke() actually runs the prompt through the language model and returns the model's response. It's used when you want to get the final 
output from the AI.

The main differences are:

Stage of processing: format_prompt() is preparatory, while invoke() executes the prompt.
Output: format_prompt() returns a PromptValue object, while invoke() returns the model's response.
Model involvement: format_prompt() doesn't involve the language model, while invoke() does.
