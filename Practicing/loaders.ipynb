When no one was there\\nand I was surrounded by self-doubts, uncertainty, and a dark\\nfuture,  I  didn’t  give  up  on  myself;  for  that,  I  want  to  thank\\nmyself.

I  want  to  thank  myself  for  doing\\neverything it took to transform my dreams into my reality.\\n\\nI  also  want  to  thank  my  Instagram  followers  &  Medium\\nreaders who have showered immense love on all my articles\\n&  posts.  A  big  thanks  for  making  me  feel  so  loved  and\\nconﬁdent. Without my readers, I am anyway, nothing.\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nDr.  Vivek  Murthy,  former  Surgeon  General  of  the  United\\nStates,  recently  wrote,  “Loneliness  and  weak  social\\nconnections  are  associated  with  a  reduction  in  lifespan\\nsimilar  to  that  caused  by  smoking  15  cigarettes  a  day”.  In\\nfact, there is a huge amount of evidence showing individuals\\nwho  report  feelings  of  loneliness  are  more  likely  to  have\\nhealth problems later in their life.\\n\\nWhen  the  idea  of  writing  this  book  came  to  my  mind,  I\\ndecided  that  I  wouldn’t  write  a  book  that  speaks  data  but\\nrather a book that speaks from one heart to another heart.\\nThat’s  what  you  need,  right?  You  don’t  care  how  many\\npeople in the world are lonely. You care about how you can\\ndeal with your loneliness.\\n\\nWell,  that’s  the  ﬁrst  problem.  Why \\n\\nloneliness\\nconsidered such a taboo in our society? Why do you hate\\nthe  idea  of  being  with  yourself  so  much  that  ‘the\\ntime  you  spend  with  yourself  is  now  considered  as\\nloneliness’  and  there  should  be  some  instant  hacks  and\\ntechniques  to  deal  with  it?  How  can  the  idea  of  being  with\\nyourself make you feel scared?\\n\\nis \\n\\nHonestly,  I  have  no  authority  to  ask  these  questions.  I\\nwasn’t very nice to myself either. I used to think that there\\nwas something wrong with me and that was the\\n\\nreason people left me. And if I can ﬁx that ‘wrong’ thing\\n\\nin me, perhaps, people will stay.\\n\\nThough,  after  spending  a  long  time  on  my  own,  ﬁguring\\nout  my  personality  and  thoughts,  I  realized  that  I  am  a\\npretty  good  person.  I  like  being  with  myself.  And  I  always\\ndid.  I  always  loved  spending  time  in  my  room,  reading  my\\nbooks,  and  wandering  to  a  distinct  place  that  only  I  am\\naware of. That always felt luxurious to me.\\n\\nI dug deeper into my past, studying why I hated the idea\\nof being on my own, and why I tried to make friends when I\\nnever wanted a big group. I am an introvert and I like having\\n\\n\\x0conly a few people around me. People who I truly love. I don’t\\nlike  to  hang  out  with  people  who  I  call  friends  and  bitch\\nabout behind their backs.\\n\\nBut then, the question traveled back to ‘why I wished for\\n\\nthe same things that I always hated?’\\n\\nAnd the answer was ‘acceptance in the society\\nWhen  I  was  still  in  high  school,  there  was  a  girl  in  my\\nclass who was all alone in a class of 150 students. I cannot\\nsay why no one talked to her because:\\n\\na) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0She was from a diﬀerent section\\nb) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0I was a new student\\n\\nYet,  those  same  people  became  my  friends.  Even  I  had\\nfriends  from  her  section.  But  she,  who  had  been  studying\\nthere  forever,  didn’t  have  any  friends.  I  used  to  see  her\\neating alone, sitting alone in the last row of the class so that\\nshe was hidden, and even going to the washroom alone. Fun\\nfact;  Girls  would  rather  control  their  pee  than  go  to  the\\nwashroom alone. But here she was, all alone.\\n\\nAnd  as  much  as  people  made  fun  of  her,  most  students\\nfelt  sorry  for  her  as  well.  I  remember  I  asked  one  of  my\\nfriends about her. I didn’t know her name so I said, ‘Hey why\\ndoes that girl from section A always seem to be alone?’\\n\\nAnd  my  friend  said,  ‘I  don’t  know.  I  never  talked  to  her\\neither  but  she  has  always  been  like  this  since  I  joined  the\\nschool. Other students say she is a weirdo, you know like…\\nyou know’\\n\\nThis  conversation \\n\\nis  the  answer  to  why  we  fear\\nloneliness. The fear of loneliness was injected into our minds\\nsince we were kids. We have learned that the kid who eats\\nalone,  sits  alone,  and  has  no  friends  is  pathetic.  In  every\\nbook  or  movie,  the  kid  who  is  eating  alone,  and  has  no\\nfriend is always featured as a weak character who needs to\\nbe  saved.  Pick  any  book  or  movie,  and  you  will  observe  a\\ncommon  pattern  around  loneliness  in  all  of  them.  These\\npeople  were  shown  as  easy  targets  or  an  object  of  your\\nsympathy.\\n\\n\\x0cNo one wants to be seen as a ‘weirdo’ hence, our dread\\nof  being  alone.  We  don’t  want  people  to  think  of  us  as  a\\nweirdo,  someone  who  needs  to  be  saved  or  mocked.\\nSomeone  who  is  unwanted  or  doesn’t  ﬁt  in  with  the  cool\\nkids.\\n\\nI  don’t  think  I  need  to  say  a  word  about  how  much  we\\ngive weight to others\\' opinions of us. It’s our life but we live\\nas  per  the  rules  of  society.  In  fact,  so  many  people  don’t\\ntake  action  on  their  goals  because  they  are  worried  about\\nwhat  people  would  think  of  them.  What  if  people  laugh  at\\nthem?  What  if  they  fail  and  everyone  sees  them  as  a\\nfailure?\\n\\nOur  lives  have  become  a  collection  of  others’  thoughts\\nand  judgments.  The  fear  of  judgment  is  enrooted  so  deep\\nwithin  us  that  before  anyone  else,  we  start  judging\\nourselves.  David  Foster  Wallace  says,  “You’ll  stop\\nworrying  what  others  think  about  you  when  you\\nrealize how seldom they do.”\\n\\n\\x0cIt’s  quite  ironic  but  your  biggest  enemy  and  critic  is\\n\\nno one else but YOU.\\n\\nBefore  anyone  else,  you  know  what  you  are  up  to,  and\\nbefore anyone can, you pass judgments on your next move\\nbased on ‘what you think people will think of you’\\n\\nLook  around  you,  no  one’s  judgments  are  louder  than\\n\\nyour own in your life.\\n\\nWhen  I  was  in  college,  I  didn’t  have  any  friends  for\\nalmost  5  months.  I  had  a  huge  ﬁght  with  my  then-friends\\nand  that  left  me  with  no  one.  While  my  other  classmates\\nwere having fun with their friends, and everyone seemed to\\nhave a ‘nice group’, I was alone. I did a good job pretending\\nthat  I  don’t  care.  And  although  I  used  to  talk  with  my\\nclassmates  and  seniors,  only  I  knew  that  I  was  alone.\\nEveryone  else  thought  I  was  having  fun  in  arranging  all\\nthese events in college, my juniors admired me for that and\\nmy classmates were jealous thinking that I was having ‘real\\nfun.’\\n\\nHow ironic.\\nDo you see the problem here?\\nNot even a single person thought that ‘I was lonely’\\xa0 Yet I\\n\\nwas worried ‘What if they think I am a loner?’\\n\\nFor a few weeks, I felt sorry for myself. Even though I was\\nhaving  a  good  time  with  my  friends  like  acquaintances,  I\\nwould ﬁnd a reason to drag myself down - thinking that I am\\nan object of sympathy for everyone.\\n\\nThough, what I realized over time is that\\nIt’s  not pathetic to  be alone.  I realized that  we don’t\\nhate being alone. We hate to believe that we are left behind.\\nAnd  that,  as  we  learned  as  a  child,  should  be  considered\\npathetic.\\n\\nWell, BULLSHIT.\\nStop  feeling  sorry  for  yourself  because  you  don’t  have\\nenough  people  to  post  a  cute  selﬁe  on  the  internet.  Stop\\n\\n \\n\\x0cthinking that you are a weirdo or there is something wrong\\nwith you.\\n\\nThere is no need to feel lonely or sorry for yourself. Being\\nalone is a part of life, it’s a part of adulting. Your friends and\\nmates  cannot  stay  with  you  for  the  rest  of  your  life.  Life\\nmoves  pretty  fast  and  everyone  is  trying  to  run  faster  so\\nthat  they  aren’t  left  behind.  The  simple  truth  of  life  is,\\npeople  leave,  for  good  or  bad,  and  life  goes  on.  Some\\npeople will leave for a better job opportunity while there will\\nbe sometimes when you will have to leave people for career\\ngrowth.  And  then  there  will  be  times  when  people  will  get\\nbored  of  you  and  they  will  ﬁnd  another  toy  to  play  with.\\nThat’s how it is.\\n\\nCan you do something about it? Probably No. But you can\\ndo one thing and that is stop feeling sorry for yourself. Stop\\nthinking that there is something wrong with you that needs\\nto be ﬁxed.\\n\\nStop trying to ﬁgure out what you can change in yourself\\n\\nor how you can pretend to look ‘perfect’\\n\\nThe  entertainment  industry  has  done  a  good  job  of\\n\\npainting a picture of ‘being alone means being lonely.’\\n\\nEspecially  in  this  digital  world  where  you  see  everyone\\non  the  internet  has  a  cute-little  group  of  friends.  Some  are\\ngoing  on  trips  with  their  friends  while  some  are  posting\\npictures  that  give  ‘friendship  goals’  and  among  all  that\\nnoise,  it’s  easier  to  think  that  you  are  the  only  lonely\\nperson. The one person who doesn’t have cool friends. The\\nonly person who wasn’t chosen.\\n\\nAnd  that,  my  friend,  is  the  primary  reason  why  people\\ntreat  being  alone  as  a  taboo.  As  a  curse  that  needs  to  be\\ndealt with.\\n\\nBut the truth is, all of this is just a pretty picture sold to\\nyou.  Hence,  the  ﬁrst  myth  that  you  need  to  unlearn  is  to\\nstop  believing  that  you  are  lonely  just  because  you  are\\nalone. And I know that it may sound a little cliché but being\\nalone and being lonely are two diﬀerent things.\\n\\n\\x0cBeing  alone  is  a  part  of  life.  But  being  lonely  means\\nviewing  yourself  from  the  lens  of  sympathy  and\\nmisery.  When  you  look  at  yourself  through  the  lens  of\\nloneliness, you feel insecure and left out. You start thinking\\nthat  there  is  something  wrong  with  you.  And  that  lowers\\nyour self-respect. You start treating the time you spend with\\nyourself as a curse - that’s loneliness. And that has nothing\\nto do with you being alone. That just deﬁnes what you think\\nof yourself.\\n\\nWhile I am writing this book, I am all alone. I don’t have\\nany friends. Not even a single soul who I can hang out with.\\nNot  because  I  am  pathetic  or  a  loner.  But  because  I  never\\nstayed in any school for longer than two years, I never had\\nthe  kind  of  best  friend  we  see  in  movies  or  books.  And  the\\nones  that  I  had  were  either  married  or  shifted  to  another\\ncity for work or college. Where does that leave me?\\n\\nWell, there are two ways to look at it.\\nOn the outside, people might think that I am a loner. I am\\nin  my  20s  so  I  should  have  fun,  go  to  parties,  dress  up\\nnicely, and have a hot date with me every Friday. And since I\\ndon’t have any of it, maybe I should take a blanket, wrap it\\naround  me,  watch  Netﬂix  on  a  loop,  and  feel  sorry  for\\nmyself.\\n\\nThough,  how  I  look  at  it  is,  I  choose  to  stay  in  my\\nhometown  because  I  want  to  stay  focused  on  my  writing\\ncareer. I am close to my parents and I can share a nice cup\\nof  coﬀee  with  my  mother  whenever  I  like.  I  can  focus  on\\nbeing me rather than trying to adopt the deﬁnition of a ‘cool\\ngirl’ and most importantly, I now like being by myself.\\n\\nWhen  I  threw  the  lens  of  loneliness  out  of  the  window,  I\\nwas able to look at my life and the opportunities around me.\\nSure, it took some time to come to peace with the fact that\\n‘I am not having fun and I am here all by myself’ but once I\\naccepted that, I was able to focus on ‘okay, what next?’ I\\nwas  able  to  create  a  lifestyle  that  I  truly  enjoy  every  day.  I\\ndon’t  wait  for  weekends  to  have  fun  with  friends.  I  look\\n\\n\\x0cforward to every day enjoying one more thing, having more\\nnew  experiences,  reading  one  more  book  that  I  always\\nwanted,  exploring  the  unexplored  areas  of  my  city,  and\\ndoing  whatever  I  always  wanted  to  ALL  BY  MYSELF.\\nWithout  anyone’s  opinion  on  my  choice,  without  any\\nintervention when I am lost in the pool of my thoughts, and\\nwithout  letting  anyone  tell  me  if  my  idea  of  fun  matches\\nsociety’s expectation of fun.\\n\\nIn  a  world  where  being  alone  is  considered  a  curse,  you\\n\\nshould get up and use it to your advantage.\\n\\nTaylor Swift said once, “the scary news is, you are on\\nyour own now. But the cool news is, you are on your\\nown now”\\n\\nIt’s  a  complete  myth  that  being  alone  means  being\\nlonely. No darling, that’s not true. Being alone doesn’t mean\\nyou are lonely.\\n\\nBeing alone means YOU ARE WITH YOURSELF.\\nI  would  recommend  you  close  the  book  and  take  a\\nminute to think about it. Once you also come to peace with\\nthe fact that being alone is not a curse. And it can be a good\\nthing, only then I shall recommend you to read further.\\n\\nI have divided the book into two sections. Part one will be\\nabout learning to turn loneliness into solitude. And part two\\nwill be about turning solitude into your growth period. Only\\nwhen  you  can  learn  to  love  solitude,  will  you  be  able  to  do\\neverything  on  your  own  that  you  expect  from  people  to  do\\nfor/with you. Shall we?\\n\\nPart 1 Turning Loneliness Into\\n\\nSolitude\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 1 - Stop Romanticizing\\n\\nLoneliness\\n\\n“If there is anything that can be crueler than death, it’s\\nnurturing false hope in your heart just to see them crushing\\nevery piece of you at the end.”\\n\\nYou  must  have  watched  those  YouTube  videos  or  maybe\\nread  books  that  encourage  you  to  romanticize  your  life,\\nhaven’t you?\\n\\nWell,  I  have.  And  to  be  honest,  only  by  watching  those\\nvideos,  do  I  fall  back  into  my  imaginary  world  where  I  am\\nthe  QUEEN  of  the  world  (at  least  of  my  world).  Just  after\\nimagining how it would feel to romanticize my life, I used to\\nfeel  a  diﬀerent  kind  of  adrenaline  rush  running  through  my\\nveins, something that I cannot explain in words.\\n\\nYou might be thinking, Renuka, if you love the concept of\\nromanticizing  life  then  why  are  you  stopping  me  to  believe\\nin it?\\n\\nWell,  after  experimenting, \\n\\nlearning,  watching,  and\\nreading  about  romanticizing  life,  I  came  up  with  this  one\\nexplanation which is: Everyone is already romanticizing\\ntheir  life.  They  just  don’t  know  the  nature  of  their\\ncharacter yet.\\nConfusing?\\nLet me tell you how you are already walking down on this\\nconcept  and  why  this  can  be  the  most  dangerous  thing  for\\nyour future.\\n\\nBut  let’s  ﬁrst  understand  what  romanticizing  life  means,\\n\\nshall we?\\n\\nRomanticizing  your \\n\\nlife  means  becoming  the  main\\ncharacter of your life as if your entire day is being recorded.\\nIn short, you act like you are in a movie playing the role of\\nthe main character.\\n\\nBut here is the thing!\\n\\n \\n\\x0cConsciously  or  unconsciously,  we  all  act  as  the  movie\\n\\ncharacter behaves.\\n\\nIn  any  typical  movie,  the  story  starts  with  a  girl  and  a\\nboy.  Either  the  girl  is  broken  and  ﬁnds  herself  in  a  dark\\ntunnel  with  depression,  stress,  and  anxiety  (not  to  mention\\na  poor  girl  is  seen  more  often)  or  the  same  situation  is\\nplayed by the boy. Then?\\n\\nThen the boy comes into her life as the HERO who saves\\nher  from  this  cruel  world,  gives  her  hope,  teaches  her  how\\nto love, and ﬁnally falls in love with her. And after that, both\\nof them face this world TOGETHER like God was conspiring\\nfrom heaven for their paths to collide.\\n\\nSounds familiar?\\nIf  not  the  girl,  then  the  boy  is  broken  and  then  the  girl\\ncomes as the Goddess to play the exact same role that we\\nhave  just  read. And if there is no love  story  then  there is a\\nfriendship  story  that  revolves  around  the  same  thing.  A\\nbroken, depressed, and pathless person meets with another\\nperson and they become best friends for life.\\n\\nMost of  the  movies/web  series/books  revolve  around the\\nsame plot where one is broken and the other one comes as\\nthe guiding Angel which I like to call good drama.\\n\\nNow,  the  problem  is  that  people  like  you  and  me  have\\nbeen  watching/listening/reading  about  these  kinds  of  life\\nincidents  since  childhood  that  subconsciously  we  have\\nmade a belief- one day someone will come to save you,\\nrescue you, or rather fall in love with you.\\n\\nAll my college life, I was waiting for a friendship like Joey\\nand  Chandler  (from  F.R.I.E.N.D.S)  but  nothing  like  that  ever\\nhappened.  I  never  had  a  best  friend  either  in  school  or  in\\ncollege  but  I  always  wanted  one.  A  kind  of  best  friend  we\\nsee  in  web  series  and  movies.  Perhaps,  that  is  the  reason\\nthat even after having a bunch of friends around me, I used\\nto feel incomplete.\\n\\nThough  if  I  look  back  in  time  and  see  the  world  from  a\\nfresh  perspective  (or  mature  perspective),  I  can  see  a  little\\n\\n\\x0cgirl  wishing  to  have  the  same  teddy  bear  she  saw  in  some\\nrandom movie.\\n\\nSo, what’s wrong with this anyway?\\nWell, your imagination shapes your reality  and here\\nyou  are.  Sitting  there,  thinking  how  broke  you  can  be  and\\nthen how a perfect angel-like person will come to save you.\\nThe problem with this is that you CHOOSE to believe that\\nYOU  ARE  NOT  ENOUGH  to  change  your  life  all  by\\nyourself. You rely your hope on someone who doesn’t exist.\\nAnd  that’s  why,  when  things  don’t  fall  as  per  your\\nimagination,  you  start  feeling  even  more  lonely  as  if  you\\nhad something but you lost it.\\n\\nIf you have created an imaginary friend in your mind who\\nyou  think  will  turn  into  reality,  I  would  say,  don’t  betray\\nyourself. No one is coming to save you or make you laugh or\\ntravel with you around the world as it happens in the movie.\\nLife  is  not  a  movie.  Move  on  from  your  own  hopes  or  get\\nready to see them crushed.\\n\\nBelieving that someday you will meet perfect friends who\\nwill  become  a  part  of  your  soul  is  more  like  creating  a\\ngraveyard  of  your  hopes.  The  more  you  focus  on  meeting\\nnew  friends,  the  more  it  will  hurt.  You  will  feel  even  more\\nlonely  thinking  that  you  could  have  something  but  you\\ndidn’t.  You  will  have  to  mourn  the  loss  of  someone  you\\nnever had in the ﬁrst place.\\n\\nI  am  not  saying  that  you  wouldn’t  meet  new  people  or\\nyou  wouldn’t  be  able  to  make  new  friends  at  all.  I  made\\nsome good friends after college through Instagram. But one\\nharsh  truth  about  that  is  -  after  a  certain  age,  you  don’t\\nmake  SOUL  friends.  You  just  meet  people,  help  each  other\\nwhen  needed  and  be  nice  to  each  other  so  that  you  have\\ngood  people  in  your  network.  As  a  content  creator,  I  come\\nacross a lot of people but I know in the end that they and I\\nare  in  touch  with  each  other  for  the  sake  of  networking.\\nAfter college, you don’t make friends. You just network. You\\n\\n\\x0cjust  try  to  be  nice  to  people  so  you  are  not  left  behind\\n(mostly).\\n\\nBut if you start imagining every person who is nice to you\\nas  your  future  buddy  then  you  are  practically  digging  a\\ngraveyard of your hopes. And let me tell you one thing from\\nexperience,  If  there  is  anything  that  can  be  crueler  than\\ndeath,  it’s  nurturing  false  hope  in  your  heart  just  to  see\\nthem crushing every piece of you at the end.\\n\\nInstead of imagining yourself as the character who needs\\nsomeone  in  the  ﬁrst  place,  imagine  yourself  as  the  main\\ncharacter of the movie that is your life. A movie like your life\\nhasn’t been made yet, and a book like your life hasn’t been\\nwritten  yet.  And  that’s  why  you  have  the  creative  freedom\\nin  your  hands  to  write  it  as  you  want,  make  it  as  bold  and\\nwild as you want, keep it as long as you can, and above all\\nmake  it  about  yourself  rather  than  following  an  old  pattern\\nthat doesn’t empower you. You don’t want to play the role of\\nvictim in your own life. You don’t want to see yourself crying\\nfor  someone  you  never  had.  You  don’t  want  to  victimize\\nyour character. Or DO YOU?\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2 - The Pain of Hiding Your\\n\\nTrue Self\\n\\n“The most painful and scariest thing in the world is to\\n\\nlook in the mirror and not recognize the person staring right\\nat you.”\\n\\nThe  false  hope  that  someday  someone  will  magically\\nshow  up  and  the  fear  of  looking  like  a  weirdo  makes  us  do\\nthings  that  we  never  intended  to  do.  Since  childhood,  we\\nhave learned that the kid who is alone is a weirdo. They are\\nalone because no one chose them. We don’t want to seem a\\nweirdo, we don’t want people to think that no one chose us\\nso  what do  we do? We start  becoming like an  ideal  version\\nof whom everyone loves. We start saying YES to things that\\nwe  hate.  We  start  dressing  up  in  clothes  that  make  us\\nuncomfortable  or  are  out  of  our  budget  but  at  the  same\\ntime  help  us  get  noticed,  accepted,  and  acknowledged.  We\\nstart  speaking  the  words  we  ﬁnd  cringe.  We  start  saying\\nthings that are most acceptable and popular. We start doing\\nthe things that make us look like ‘everyone’ else so that we\\ndon’t  come  out  as  weirdo.  We,  indeed,  become  an  ideal\\nversion  of  a  happy,  cute-little  human  who  everyone  adores\\nor  at  least  no  one  makes  fun  of.  But  step  by  step,  as  we\\nbecome  like  everyone  else,  we  go  far  away  from  who  we\\ntruly are. The more thought you give to what people think of\\nyou, the less attention you give to what you want, what you\\nlike,  what  you  think,  how  you  would  like  to  enjoy  life,  and\\nmore importantly what makes you, YOU. It’s like becoming a\\npeople  pleaser  without  realizing  it.  The  gap  between  who\\nyou truly were and who you have become in the hope to ﬁt\\nin grows so much that even you ﬁnd it diﬃcult to recognize\\nyourself.\\n\\nAnd that gives birth to the root of loneliness. People start\\nbecoming  like  the  most  acceptable  version  in  the  hope  to\\n\\n\\x0cﬁnd  their  tribe  that  they  lose  their  real  selves.  And  that  is\\nthe  reason  why  we  call  the  time  we  spend  with  ourselves\\n‘lonely.’  Loneliness  is  not  when  you  don’t  have  people\\naround.  Loneliness  occurs  when  you  cannot  ﬁnd  yourself\\ninside  you.  The  moment  you  feel  the  loss  of  your  real  self,\\nthat’s when loneliness makes a home inside you. That’s the\\nworst kind of loneliness where you might be surrounded by\\npeople yet you feel lonely. It’s like you cannot feel yourself.\\nLike you are not there anymore.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd do you what’s even more ironic?\\nIt starts with you trying to become someone you are not\\nbecause you wanted to ﬁt in. But it leaves you hating being\\nwith  yourself.  And  tell  me  something,  how  can  anyone\\naccept  a  person  who  doesn’t  accept  themselves?  How  can\\nanyone love to spend time with\\n\\na  person  who  hates  spending  time  with  themselves?\\nWhere  does  it  leave  you?  Nowhere.  In  the  race  of\\nachieving  people’s  acceptance  and  love,  you  end  up\\nlosing yourself.\\n\\nI  have  spent  the  majority  of  my  life  trying  to  be  nice  to\\npeople  so  that  I  can  be  an  ideal  version.  I  said  ‘Yes’  to\\noutings  when  I  wanted  to  stay  at  home  and  read  books.  I\\nkept  talking  and  smiling  when  I  wanted  to  say  that  I  am\\ntired or I have got some work to do so I will catch up later. I\\neven dressed up when I wanted to go casual. All of it so that\\nI could be what people wanted me to be.\\n\\nHowever,  what  I  didn’t  realize  at  that  point  was  that  ‘I\\nmay  have  become  an  ideal  version  for  others  but  what\\nabout myself?’\\n\\nWhat  do  I  think  of  myself?  What  are  my  opinions  about\\nmyself?  What  do  I  like  and  what  do  I  don’t?  What  are  my\\nfears? What are some things that I want to do in my day-to-\\nday  life  yet  I  don’t  because  I  have  become  an  expert  in\\nsilencing my inner voice?\\n\\nAnd  I  know  I  am  not  alone  in  this.  We  all  are  the  same.\\nSince  childhood,  we  have  competed  against  each  other.\\n\\n\\x0cWhose child  is cutest  or smarter  or more intelligent?  Either\\nwe try to be a perfect version of ourselves for our parents so\\nthat  they  can  be  proud  of  us  or  we  try  to  appear  cool  and\\nfun  so  that  we  can  be  a  part  of  the  most  popular  group  in\\ncollege.\\n\\nWe  ran  in  this  race  for  so  long  that  our  real  selves\\ncouldn’t  keep  up  with  our  pace  of  changing  personalities.\\nOur  real  self  is  hidden  deep  inside  under  the  layers  of\\nmanners,  and  etiquette.  We  do  the  things  that  seem  cool\\ninstead of trying new things that our soul wants. I am a pro\\nat  that.  I  want  to  learn  a  bunch  of  new  things  but  I  don’t\\nhave  time.  Yet  if  any  of  my  friends  call  me  and  share  their\\nshit, I will be all ears so that they have a shoulder to cry on.\\nWhat  we  don’t  realize  is  that  just  as  we  stop  talking  to\\nignore  us.  Similarly,  our  souls  stop\\npeople  who \\ncommunicating  with  us.  And  one  day  when  you  are  alone\\nwith  no  one  to  hang  out  with  or  click  sassy  pictures  with,\\nyou ﬁnd spending time with yourself painful. Why?\\n\\nBecause there is so  much  hidden  that  if  you  sit  down  to\\nuncover  the  layers,  years  will  go  by  but  you  wouldn’t  be\\nable to ﬁnd the real YOU.\\n\\nThat’s why I say,\\n\\n“There are some days when you miss yourself\\n\\nmore than you have ever missed anyone else”\\n\\nI  am  no  expert  in  psychology  nor  am  I  a  therapist  who\\ncan talk about what goes inside a human brain. But I am a\\nhuman and I know what goes inside a human’s heart. We all\\nare trapped in the same cycle of pleasing people around us\\nso  that  we  are  more  accepted  and  appreciated.  We  ignore\\nwhat  we  are  feeling  because  who  has  time  for  that?  We\\ndon’t do what gives us real joy because that’s probably old\\nschool.\\n\\nThe  burden  gets  heavier  with  each  passing  day.  With\\nevery  day  your  real  self  goes  far  away  from  you.  Your  own\\nimages become blurry. And it becomes painful to take a look\\ndeep inside yourself.\\n\\n\\x0cI  have  made  these  mistakes  and  I  don’t  want  you  to  do\\nthat.  So  in  the  next  few  chapters,  we  will  discuss  how  you\\ncan  become  more  YOU  which  will  help  you  turn  your  alone\\ntime into solitude.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3 - How to Be YOU\\n\\nThe  need  to  ﬁt  in,  to  be  like  the  most  famous  and  cool\\nperson, and to be accepted lovingly is inherited in all of us.\\nBut how long do you think you can handle this? For how long\\ndo  you  think  you  can  suppress  and  hide  your  real  identity?\\nFor  how  long  are  you  going  to  be  diﬀerent  from  diﬀerent\\npeople? You try to be diﬀerent for everyone around you. You\\nare  diﬀerent  for  your  partner,  diﬀerent  for  your  boss,\\ndiﬀerent for your friends, and diﬀerent for your loved ones.\\n\\nAnd in all of this, THE REAL YOU IS LOST. YOU HAVE LOST\\nYOUR REAL ESSENCE, YOUR REAL SELF. Imagine Yourself as\\na computer and see how you have opened diﬀerent tabs of\\nyour  personality  for  each  person  you  meet.  New  person,\\nnew tab. Perhaps, that\\'s the reason your real personality has\\ncrashed.\\n\\nIt’s  not  like  I  am  a  saint.  I  have  tried  hard  to  change\\nmyself into the most acceptable and loving version as well.\\nIn fact, there are times when by default, I try to hide who I\\ntruly  am  or  what  I  am  thinking  just  to  present  myself  as  a\\n‘wanted’ person. Why? Why do we have to try so hard to get\\nothers\\' attention and is it worth losing our real identity?\\n\\nAnd  do  you  know  what’s  funny?  After  losing  ourselves\\ncompletely, we fall for those ‘self-love’ hacks. Sometimes, I\\nfeel like we are kidding ourselves.\\n\\nI am not a love expert. God forbid. But I know one thing\\nthat  you  fall  in  with  someone  when  you  get  to  know  them.\\nIsn’t it?\\n\\nSo, let’s ﬁnd YOU so that you can fall in love with the real\\n\\nYOU. Shall we?\\n\\n \\n\\x0cI. Self-Love Starts with Self-\\n\\nAcceptance\\n\\nI  have  been  using  social  media  like  a  spy  for  the  past\\nyear. During this time, I have seen the growing popularity of\\n“self-love”  and  the  more  deﬁnitions  I  read  on  self-love,  the\\nless I became interested in even thinking about self-love.\\n\\nSelf-love has become more like self-pity.\\nIf  that  wasn’t  enough,  giant  companies  and  clever\\nmarketers took advantage of this growing popularity of self-\\nlove to sell cute shampoo bottles, expensive perfumes, and\\nthings  like  that.  While  I  will  never  understand  how  self-love\\nbecame about decorating yourself from head to toe, I want\\nto share what self-love really means. A deﬁnition that is less\\naccepted and discussed.\\n\\nAs clear cut as possible, self-love is about two things:\\n\\n1. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nKnowing  Yourself:  What  you  think,  how  you\\nthink,  what  is  your  true  nature,  what  is  hidden\\nbehind all the manners and etiquettes, what is your\\npersonality  and  the  like  (we  will  discuss  that  in  the\\nnext chapter)\\n\\nAccepting  Yourself:  Acknowledging  everything\\nthat is inside you and accepting it, be it good or bad.\\nMost  people  hide  their  ugly  side  somewhere  deep\\ninside them so that no one can know their dark side.\\nHowever,  what  you  don’t  realize  is  that  the  deeper\\nyou  hide,  the  darker  it  gets  inside  your  heart.  And\\nthat  darkness  will  swallow  you  bit  by  bit  until  you\\ncan no longer ﬁnd the sunshine.\\n\\n \\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x0cSociety  has  made  us  believe  that  we  must  always  be\\nloving,  caring,  and  cute.  That’s  what  we  see  in  movies  and\\nweb series, right? Good people are good to everyone all the\\ntime.  And  we  all  install  a  desire  subconsciously  that  ‘there\\nare good humans and bad humans and if we can fall under\\nthe  good  human  category  then  we  will  be  loved  and\\nappreciated and accepted as well.’\\n\\nThen?\\nWe try hard to be NICE. We try to be good to people even\\nwhen  they  are  abusive  to  us  because  that’s  what  good\\npeople  do,  right?  And  this  trial  period  keeps  draining  you\\nbecause  how  can  you  be  good  all  the  time?  How  can  you\\nlove  others  when  you  are  hurt  yourself?  How  can  you  be\\nkind  when  you  need  to  help  yourself?  You  keep  trying  to\\nmeet  the  criteria  of  being  a  good  person  until  you  kill\\nsomething  inside  you.  And  then  suddenly  you  realize,  oh,  I\\nneed healing?\\n\\nWOW! What a trap.\\nAnd this reminds me that even though we all want to be\\ngood  and  nice  yet  we  sympathize  more  with  the  villain  of\\nany web series or book. WHY?\\n\\nBecause  villains  show  us  that  ‘we  all  can  be  bad  at\\ntimes  not  intentionally  but  because  we  are  designed\\nto feel all kinds of emotions. We are not mobile phones\\nwhere you cannot use Android features in ios or ios features\\nin  Android  devices.  You  are  a  HUMAN.  For  God\\'s  sake,\\nstart treating yourself like one.’\\n\\nVillains teach us that our dark side doesn’t deﬁne us but\\nit  is  still  a  part  of  us.  Since  society  is  not  very  welcoming\\nwith  traits  that  don’t  fall  under  the  good  girl  or  good  boy\\ncategory,  we  just  try  to  suppress  everything  inside  us  that\\nwe genuinely feel, think, and love. I don’t know when you or\\nI  started  silencing  our  inner  voice  but  we  have  done  it\\nsuccessfully enough to seek the deﬁnition of self-love in the\\nexternal world.\\n\\n\\x0cIf  you  ask  me,  I  used  to  think  I  am  a  good  person  too.  I\\nbelieve  in  kindness,  love,  compassion,  and  being  warm  to\\npeople.  I  want  to  be  the  reason  people  still  believe  in\\nkindness  and  love.  But  at  the  same  time,  I  know  I  am  not\\nGod  and  I  make  mistakes.  Mistakes  that  at  times  hurt\\npeople. But hating myself for making mistakes or\\n\\nfor  letting  go  of  people  or  for  saying  whatever  I  feel\\n\\ncannot make me love myself.\\n\\nSo,  can  we  please  stop  playing  this  game?  Can  YOU\\n\\nplease stop pretending that your dark side doesn’t exist?\\n\\nLet  me  share  an  example  from  my  own  life  so  you  can\\nrelate better. As I said, I want to be nice to people so that I\\ndon’t become the reason someone cries. But after 2 years of\\nconstant  self-examination,  I  have  studied  my  behavior.  And\\nthat behavior says that I can be selﬁsh at times. Yes, that’s\\ntrue. I am not all good nor am I God. I have chosen ME over\\nmy friends many times.\\n\\nAlthough,  the  whole  self-love  journey  made  me  realize\\n\\nthat ‘it’s okay to accept myself as a selﬁsh person.’\\n\\nThat’s  one  of  the  truths  about  me.  I  know  good  people\\nare  not  supposed  to  be  selﬁsh  but  I  am.  I  can  either  hate\\nmyself  for  that  or  learn  to  use  this  one  trait  in  my  favor.\\nLearning  to  choose  myself,  my  happiness,  and  my  career\\nover anything.\\n\\nThis one truth about me made me realize how I function\\nin  relationships  (with  friends  &  family).  Since  I  know  my\\nbehavior, I would always set my expectations\\n\\nclearly  so  people  know  what  they  can  expect  from  me.\\nThis  clarity  is  what  brings  peace  to  your  relationship  with\\nyourself and others.\\n\\nIf you don’t know yourself, you will make similar mistakes\\nin your relationships with everyone and then if people leave\\nyou, you will say “Why doesn’t anyone want to be with me?\\nMaybe  I  am  not  just  lovable,  or  maybe  there  is  something\\nwrong with me that pushes people away.”\\n\\n\\x0cSelf-love, my dear, is not only about taking bubble baths,\\napplying  expensive  makeup  to  call  it  a  self-care  day.  That\\njust deﬁnes your lifestyle.\\n\\nSelf-love  is  about  knowing  everything  about  yourself,\\nhowever  ugly  or  dark  or  bad  your  truth  is,  and  accepting\\nyourself with it. Self-love is about knowing how to transform\\nyour  ﬂaws  into  your  strengths  rather  than  hiding  them\\ninside you so that no one can see them.\\n\\nSelf-love  is  about  choosing  yourself  every  single  day  to\\nstudy  your  patterns,  examine  your  behavior,  knowing  your\\nthoughts (even if they are mean at times). Self-love is about\\ncreating  a  home  deep  inside  you  where  you  can  be  YOU\\nwithout  worrying \\nor\\nperfectionism.  You  are  beautiful  with  your  dark  side  not  by\\nhiding them under the mask of goodness.\\n\\npretending, \\n\\nhealing, \\n\\nabout \\n\\nI feel pathetic to say that there is a dark side in all of us.\\nBecause  it’s  not  even  our  dark  side,  it’s  just  who  we  are.\\nThat is how we are designed. That’s what makes us unique\\nand  diﬀerent  from  each  other.  You  don’t  have  to  be  bad  to\\npeople.\\n\\nYou  just  have  to  learn  to  not  loathe  yourself  for\\nhaving some traits that are not accepted in our well-\\ndressed  society.  Be  proud  of  what  you  are  and  accept\\nevery bit of yourself.\\n\\nNow  that  you  know  that  you  don’t  have  to  be  all  classy\\nand glassy to love yourself, I guess it will be a lot easier to\\nget to know yourself. Let’s go on the journey of meeting you\\nthen. Shall we?\\n\\n \\n\\x0cII. Self-Love Grows with Self-\\n\\nKnowledge\\n\\n“Your inner world has more wonders than the 7 wonders\\n\\nof the world”\\n\\nI wish I could tell you some hacks and techniques to get\\nto know yourself or perhaps, a schedule or a video that you\\ncan  follow  but  the  sad  news  is,  you  are  not  a  subject  that\\nyou can just study, understand, and close the book. You are\\na  human.  Well,  yes  not  brand-new  information.  But  without\\nstretching  it  unnecessarily,  as  humans,  we  change  rapidly.\\nWe  evolve.  Our  preferences  change  and  our  working  style\\nchanges  and  our  priorities  change.  What  worked  for  you\\nyesterday might not work for you tomorrow. What you liked\\n3 months back may not be your preference today. How you\\nliked to spend your time 6 months back might be something\\nyou hate today.\\n\\nHence,  hands  down.  I  am  sorry  but  I  cannot  give  some\\nrandom hacks that just sound good on paper, and make you\\nfeel inspired at the moment just to make you feel guilty for\\nnot following them later. Yes, I know this is a self-help book\\nand \\nI  am  supposed  to  give  you  some  good-looking\\ntechniques.  But  darling,  you  are  not  a  constant  self-\\nimprovement project.\\nA Journey to Self,\\nKnowing yourself is not a one-day job or a 3-week\\nlong project. It’s a life-long journey. We are living in a\\nworld  of  distractions.  It  takes  less  than  a  second  to\\nstart  wishing  for  something  that  we  never  wanted\\njust because everyone else seems to have it/enjoy it.\\nIn such a world, where you are always surrounded by\\nnoise, it’s tough to stay connected to the voice deep\\ninside  you.  And  let me  repeat it again,  it’s a lifelong\\n\\n \\n\\x0cprocess  to  know  yourself  and  secondly  not  to  lose\\nyourself.\\n\\nThere  are  a  few  things  that  helped  me  and  I  hope  they\\nwill  help  you  as  well.  These  are  not  instant  hacks  but\\neveryday  habits  that  I  follow  to  date  so  be  ready  for  the\\nexecution of them.\\n\\nA) Come Face-to-Face With Your\\n\\nMind\\n\\n“It is a joy to be hidden, and disaster not to be found.”\\n― D.W. Winnicott\\n\\nWhen you are alone, you are dealing with just one mind,\\nYOUR MIND. Some treat it as a luxury while others treat it as\\na punishment.\\n\\nDuring your alone time, you are on your own. Your mind\\nhas  a  way  of  pulling  you  back  to  everything  that  had  or\\ncould go wrong in your life. Your mind plays tricks on you to\\ncreate unnecessary worries.\\n\\nWhen Covid-19 hit the world and we were forced to stay\\nat  our  homes,  I  did  a  lot  of  digging  in  my  mind.  Initially,  it\\nfelt more like a punishment because duh! I wasn’t ready to\\nlisten  to  the  1,000  thoughts  that  my  mind  was  generating\\nevery  other  minute.  It  was  at  that  moment,  I  realized  how\\nmy  mind  never  sleeps  and  always  gives  me  a  reason  to\\nworry  about.  Hence,  the  itch  to  go  out  in  public  and  ignore\\nthe mind’s voice.\\n\\n \\n\\x0cPerhaps,  this  is  the  reason  why  so  many  people  end  up\\nbeing  in  toxic  relationships.  People  are  afraid  of  what  their\\nmind will do to them, they are afraid of what their mind will\\nmake  them  believe,  and  they  are  afraid  of  what  their  mind\\nwill push them to do (in my case, calling my mean friends)\\n\\nAs  Rollo  May  said:  “Many  people  suﬀer  from  the  fear  of\\nﬁnding  oneself  alone,  and  so  they  don’t  ﬁnd  themselves  at\\nall.”\\n\\nThough I dug deeper into the problem and said to myself,\\nbeing with me doesn’t have to be so cruel and tough if only I\\nbecome  more  mindful.  I  started  doing  more  ‘meet-ups  with\\nmy mind’ to understand myself better. To know what goes in\\nmy  mind,  how  I  think,  how  I  react,  what  triggers  me,  and\\nbasically everything that I was once afraid of uncovering.\\n\\nAnd if there is anything that I realized with these regular\\n‘meetings’  with  my  mind,  it’s  that,  your  mind  is  not  stupid\\nnor  it’s  your  enemy.  You  cannot  stand  being  with  yourself\\nbecause there is so much buried inside you. Things that you\\ndon’t want to admit.\\n\\nThough,  let  me  tell  you  one  thing.  There  is  FREEDOM  in\\nknowing  yourself.  You  feel  like  nothing  can  hurt  you  when\\nyou  face  everything  that  your  mind  was  threatening  you\\nabout.\\n\\nSo, instead  of  ﬁnding ways  to  silence your mind.  Get up\\nand come face-to-face with whatever your mind has to oﬀer\\nyou.\\n\\nThere  were  things  about  myself  that  I  didn’t  want  to\\nadmit  (my  default  behavioral  pattern  in  certain  situations)\\nHowever,  now  that  I  have  accepted  it,  I  don’t  fear  my  own\\nmind. I am working on those things to upgrade myself.\\n\\nUse  your  alone  time  to  KNOW  YOURSELF.  When  you  are\\nalone,  you  are  dealing  with  just  one  mind,  one  set  of\\nchoices, behavior, and thinking patterns. Hence, it becomes\\neasier to  study  yourself  and get  to  know what you  like and\\nwhat you don’t like, how you think, and how you react.\\n\\n\\x0cThe reason why most people ﬁnd it so diﬃcult to sit with\\n\\nthemselves or read their own thoughts is that;\\n\\nThere \\n\\nis  too  much  untapped  and  unnoticed.  And\\nobviously,  years  of  ignorance  have  created  a  vast  pool  of\\nthings  that  you  need  to  deal  with.  So,  it  may  seem  a  little\\nscary  when  you  sit  and  boom!  Your  mind  starts  attacking\\nyou.  One  bad  thing  you  did  years  ago,  some  regrets  and\\nmistakes  that  are  living  in  your  mind  rent-free  to  give  you\\nsomething  to  worry  about  on  days  you  ﬁnally  decide  to  be\\nhappy,  or  maybe  some  bad  thoughts  that  keep  returning\\nback even when you don’t want them.\\n\\nMost people cannot muster enough courage to face it all\\nhence,  the  smarter  way  seems  to  be  to  silence  it  all  by\\nthrowing  short-term  pleasure  on  your  face  like  watching\\nNetﬂix, or going out with people who you don’t like.\\n\\nThe simple fact that you don’t know yourself is the\\nreason why you accept the bare minimum from\\npeople.\\n\\nThey  help  distract  you  and  this  is  what  you  want,  don’t\\n\\nyou?\\n\\nSo, yes, there is a lot inside you. But it is all a part of you\\nso there is no permanent escape. You have to face it all. One\\nday  at  a  time.  One  thought,  one  regret,  one  guilt,  one  bad\\ndecision at a time.\\n\\nAnd I promise, once you face it all, once you uncover all\\nthe  layers  of  your  past,  once  you  acknowledge  everything\\nthat  your  mind  was  threatening  you  against,  you  will  feel\\nFREE like you can take a breath without any fear. That’s the\\nstart of peace.\\n\\nSo,  give  yourself  the  time  it  requires  to  uncover  what’s\\nburied  inside  you.  Everything  that  you  have  been  ignoring\\nfor such a long time. Every thought you are afraid to accept.\\nEvery  decision  that  you  regret  taking/not  taking.  Set\\nyourself FREE.\\n\\nIt  won\\'t  be  easy  but  it  will  be  worth  it.  It  will  take  some\\ntime.  But  my  advice  to  you  is,  if  you  can  do  one  thing,  I\\n\\n\\x0crecommend  you  to  try  this  challenge.  Every  day  takes  at\\nleast 10-15 minutes to just be with your soul. You must take\\nout  some  time  to  know  yourself,  a  time  when  you  don’t\\nhave  to  fake  it  and  when  you  can  completely  accept\\nyourself without any judgments or fear.\\n\\nPractice: Sit With Yourself & Try to Read Your Thoughts.\\nRead your thoughts like you are reading a classic book. Like\\nyou are spending time with the most amazing person on this\\nplanet.  You  can  say  and  feel  anything  without  worrying\\nabout what people would say. You can share your trauma or\\nunhealed past as if you are your own therapist.\\n\\nAnd one day, it will become interesting to get to know so\\nmuch  about yourself.  You will  feel excited to  know why  you\\nlaugh  at  a  certain  joke  and  why  you  eat  a  certain  dish  in  a\\ncertain  style.  It  will  start  feeling  like  falling  in  love  with\\nyourself.\\n\\n\\x0cB) Know Thyself\\n\\n“The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong\\n\\nto oneself.”\\n\\n-Michel de Montaigne\\n\\nI was in high school when one of my professors said this,\\n‘You all seem to act too smart as if you are the kings/queens\\nof  the  world  while  in  reality,  if  I  ask  you  to  speak  about\\nyourself for as many minutes as your age, 18 minutes let’s\\nsay if that’s your age, then none of you can speak even for\\na minute.’  He  continued,  ‘and  when  I  say  about  yourself,  I\\ndon’t  mean  the  worldly  tags  that  you  have  accumulated,  I\\nmean the REAL YOU.’\\n\\nBack then, I didn’t understand what he meant. I thought\\nhe  was  being  angry  for  no  reason.  But  now  after  reading  a\\nbunch  of  spiritual  books,  following  the  path  of  spirituality\\nmyself,  and  paying  attention  to  my  soul,  I  have  come  to\\nrealize  that  you  and  I  are  beyond  the  title  of  this  world.\\nThough, we all have become a collection of tags and labels\\nthat  we  have  either  willingly  imposed  on  ourselves  or  that\\nthe world threw at us. The tags of a good or bad person. Sad\\nor  happy.  Poor  or  rich.  Loving  or  hateful.  Failure  or\\nsuccessful.  Writer  or  Lawyer.  Beautiful  or  Ugly.  Smart  or\\ndumb.  Supportive  or  toxic.  And  the  list  of  such  fancy  tags\\nwouldn’t come to an end until the day you die.\\n\\nAnd death reminds me of birth.\\nWhen you and I were ﬁrst born, we were free from all the\\nworldly tags. For us, nothing was good or bad. We were just\\nthere  at  the  moment.  Perhaps,  that  is  the  reason  why\\npeople love babies so much. When you are with a baby, the\\nbaby  doesn’t  judge  you  based  on  the  black-and-white\\nspeciﬁc  tags.  The  baby  doesn’t  say  ‘Oh  this  girl  is  brown.  I\\nwish  a  young  white  tall  lady  was  carrying  me.’  The  baby\\ndoesn’t  say  ‘I  don’t  want  to  be  around  this  dumb  person\\n\\n \\n\\x0cwho  cannot  score  good  grades  or  I  will  be  like  him.’  The\\nbaby  doesn’t  judge  you  based  on  past  mistakes,  future\\nendeavors, color, religion, or social status. The baby is just a\\ncute little creature looking right into your eyes with curiosity.\\nYou  make  funny  faces  so  the  baby  laughs  and  when  the\\nbaby  does,  it  makes  you  so  happy  as  if  you  have  won  a\\nNobel prize.\\n\\nWHY? Why is happiness so cheap when you are around a\\nbaby?  Why  are  you  so  YOU  when  you  are  holding  a  baby?\\nAnd most of all why don’t you judge a baby when you look\\nat him? Why don’t you say that this baby would have been a\\nlittle  more  attractive  if  he  was  a  little  cuter,  or  born  into  a\\nrich  family?  Why  don’t  you  compare  a  baby  to  any  other\\nbaby?\\n\\nBecause  the  baby  allows  you  to  be  YOU  without  making\\nyou feel insecure about the shape of your nose, the color of\\nyour  skin,  the  zeros  in  your  bank  balance,  or  your  grades.\\nYou can be YOU when you hold a baby and so can a baby be\\njust  a  little  human  without  getting  any  life  advice  or\\njudgments from you.\\n\\nThe  tragedy  is  we  all  were  babies  once  too.  We  all  used\\nto spread love with our smiles whenever anyone took us in\\ntheir  arms.  We  all  were  once  complete  and  beautiful.  And\\nwe  used  to  make  other  people  feel  complete  and  beautiful\\ntoo without giving them any tags.\\n\\nI  cannot  say  exactly  which  concept,  incident,  or  system\\nmade  us  question  ourselves  and  others  but  somehow  we\\nlost. We lost our capability to be happy for no reason, to feel\\nbeautiful, and to not judge ourselves or others.\\n\\nIt  may  have  all  started  when  we  started  accumulating\\ntags from the external world. The more tags we collect, the\\nfaster  we  start  losing  our  authentic  selves.  Society  likes  to\\nput  you  in  a  box  because  it  is  easier  that  way  to  market\\nproducts.  If  you  are  black,  buy  this  fairness  cream  and  so\\non.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd it is even sadder that you start treating yourself and\\nothers as a tag. But enough of this stupid system that likes\\nto  cage  everyone.  This  system  is  stupid  because  no  one  is\\nhappy. And I am here to beat that system. It starts with you\\nand me.\\n\\nAnd to break that system, here is what we can do:\\nFree Yourself and Others:\\nWhen I was around 10, there was a death in my family. It\\nwas my grandfather’s brother’s wife. And I remember one of\\nmy relatives was talking about me. She said ‘I don’t look as\\ngood as other girls in my family do’\\n\\nCan  you  imagine?  There  is  a  dead  body  and  people  are\\n\\nbusy judging you. What do you think I must have felt?\\n\\nI  remember  not  considering  myself  beautiful  till  the  age\\nof  17.  And  I  know  how  it  feels  to  be  judged  so  badly.  But\\nwhat  I  also  remember  is  ‘I  tagged  myself  as  ugly’  and  that\\nshattered my conﬁdence till 17.\\n\\nIt  happens  to  all  of  us.  Everyone  gets  diﬀerent  kinds  of\\ntags  from  the  world  and  starts  deﬁning  themselves  as  per\\nthe  tag.  And  that  tag  can  leave  its  imprint  on  your  heart\\nuntil you can no longer bear its burden.\\n\\nSo  I  would  suggest  you  let  go  of  all  the  tags  that  the\\nworld  has  thrown  at  you,  tags  that  you  have  attached  to\\nyour  soul,  and  free  others  from  the  tags  you  give  to  them.\\nDon’t  deﬁne  people.  Don’t  put  people  in  a  box.  Don’t  give\\nthem tags. Because your one tag can be a pain in someone\\nelse’s  heart.  And,  if  someone  else  is  giving  you  tags  (be  it\\ngood or bad), instantly mutter in your mind ‘yet another tag.\\nBut I don’t want it’\\n\\nBe  free  and  let  others  be  free  too.  Don’t  make  life  so\\n\\nspeciﬁc that it feels like carrying a burden.\\n\\nWhen  we  start  deﬁning  ourselves  with  one  particular\\nthing,  our  entire  focus  revolves  around  it.  And  when  that\\none thing goes wrong, we feel like a failure. And it’s not just\\nabout the profession but personal relationships as well.\\n\\n\\x0cFor example; If I say I am an author and put it as a label,\\nI will always judge myself based on the number of copies of\\nmy books have been sold, how many people loved my book,\\nand things around it. And if someone doesn’t like my work,\\ndoes that make me a bad writer?\\n\\nSomething  similar  happens  in  personal  relationships  as\\nwell. When we become attached to one person/relationship,\\nthat  person  or  relation  starts  deﬁning  our  existence.  That\\nperson can control our lives. That relationship can break our\\nhearts  into  pieces  if someday  it ends.  It could be  with  your\\nromantic partner or your parents. If your mother doesn’t\\n\\nacknowledge  your  eﬀorts,  does  that  make  you  a  bad\\n\\ndaughter?\\n\\nAm  I  just  a  collection  of  tags  and  labels?  And  should  I\\nspend  my  life  collecting  all  the  good  tags  like  a  good\\ndaughter,  loving  partner,  good  sister,  supportive  friend,  a\\ngood  writer,  and  more  such  tags  that  are  well  accepted  in\\nsociety?\\n\\nAnd  what  if  someday  I  fail?  What  if  I  end  up  hurting  my\\nmy  friends  because  I  have  my  shit  to  deal  with?  Does  that\\nmake  me  a  bad  person?  What  if  my  books  don’t  do  well?\\nShould I stop writing then?\\n\\nI  believe  that  we  are  beyond  the  titles  of  the  external\\nworld. I think a particular word cannot deﬁne our core being.\\nOne tag cannot describe you or me. We are more than just\\nour  professional  goals  and  personal  life  relationships.  All\\nthese things are external.\\n\\nYou  and  I  are  a  piece  of  everything  we  owned,  every\\nplace  we  have  traveled,  every  person  we  met,  and  every\\nword  we  read.  Everything  leaves  a  mark  on  our  soul  that\\npaints our personality into who we are today.\\n\\nWe  are  stitched  together  by  the  songs  we  enjoy,  people\\nwe  love,  adventurous  experiences  we  have  had,  books  we\\nread  and  the  characters  in  them  that  we  lived  for  a  while,\\nand  many  more  small  things  like  these  that  shape  our\\nperception and personality.\\n\\n\\x0cBut  when  we  remain  restricted  to  one  particular  tag,  we\\nput ourselves in a cage while expecting to behave/talk/think\\nin a certain way. Perhaps, that is why there is no uniqueness\\nleft  in  you  and  me.  We  are  walking  on  the  same  path  as\\neveryone else.\\n\\nBut I think that our entire personality or existence should\\nnot revolve around one person or one thing or one tag. We\\nshould be undeﬁnable. Like no one can put us in a cage.\\nLike if someone even tries to deﬁne us, it should take them\\nhours to talk about our personality. Like I don’t want people\\nto  say,  ‘Renuka  is  a  great  author  with  excellent  writing\\nskills’\\n\\nI want people to say, ‘Renuka writes in a way that makes\\nyou feel safe, loved, and understood. She loves writing and\\nreading. She lives in a world that exists beyond the human\\nmind. She loves nature and often ﬁnds herself gazing at the\\nclear sky to ﬁnd a hidden secret of the Universe. She loves\\ncoﬀee and she drinks it like it’s a drop of heaven’\\n\\nI  understand  these  things  cannot  be  noticed  by  others\\nbut they can be noticed by you. You can live more. You can\\nbecome  indescribable  for  yourself.  Like  if  you  take  a  pause\\nto talk about what you do, you have to think ‘What should I\\ntalk about ﬁrst?’\\n\\nAnd that’s why I said earlier, learning about yourself is a\\nlifelong  process.  You  change  every  day  a  little.  You  evolve\\nwith every song, every book, every article, every video, and\\nevery thought you come across. This is the reason sitting for\\nonce  and  deﬁning  yourself  wouldn’t  work.  If  you  want  to\\nknow  yourself,  you  have  to  be  interested  in  yourself\\nfor  the  rest  of  your  life.  And  you  must  remember  one\\nthing,\\n\\nYou  are  beyond  a  particular  tag.  You  cannot  be  labeled.\\nBe  undeﬁnable.  Let  them  wonder  who  you  are  while  you\\ncreate a personality for yourself that makes you fall in love\\nwith yourself every day.\\n\\n\\x0cIII. Deﬁne Who & What You Are Not\\n\\nLet  me  tell  you  one  thing.  When  you  will  walk  on  the\\njourney  of  self-exploration,  you  will  realize  one  thing,  you\\nare not easy which is a good thing. But that is one of the key\\nreasons why people give up on themselves. It becomes a lot\\nmore to handle than it sounds.\\n\\nIn fact, when I started my self-exploration journey, I was\\noverwhelmed  and  confused.  I  didn’t  know  where  to  start.  I\\nam  not  a  subject  and  there  wasn’t  any  index  that  I  could\\nfollow.  And  after  a  lot  of  trial  &  error,  reading,  and\\nexperimenting,  I  followed  one  piece  of  advice  that  helped\\nme get started on my journey.\\n\\nThe advice: If you cannot ﬁgure out who you are, ﬁgure\\n\\nout who you are not and who you don’t want to be.\\n\\nIt’s  easier to  know who  you  are not and  what you  never\\nwant to be than to start with who you are in the ﬁrst place.\\nWhen you make a list of who you are not, and who you don’t\\nwant  to  be,  you  will  also  get  a  sense  of  clarity  about  what\\nyou don’t like and why you don’t like certain things. It helps\\nyou  get  to  know  your  choices,  principles,  and  thinking\\npatterns better.\\n\\nYou  can  start  by  making  a  list  of  things  you  hate  or  you\\nare  against  (even  if  those  things  are  well-accepted  in\\nsociety) and alongside, write or make a mental note of why\\nyou don’t like those things.\\n\\nTASK:  Take  it  as  your  assignment  or  task  or  whatever\\nyou want to call it. Sit down every day for 5 minutes, alone\\nwith  no  disturbance  around  you.  Let  yourself  be  immersed\\nin  your  personality.  Write  down  one  or  two  things  that  you\\nthink you don’t like and then write why you don’t like those\\nthings.  It  will  help  you  to  know  your  values,  hence,  getting\\ncloser  to  yourself  a  little.  Not  only  that,  but  you  will  also\\nunderstand  that  you  are  not  a  follower  and  that  you  don’t\\naccept  every  deﬁnition  that’s  been  thrown  at  you.  It  will\\n\\n \\n\\x0chelp  you  THINK  INDEPENDENTLY  without  accepting  the\\nworld’s deﬁnition.\\n\\nThough,  let  me  give  you  a  warning.  As  you  get  to  know\\nmore  things  that  you  are  against  but  the  world  accepts,\\nnever share those things with anyone. Yes, I am asking you\\nto keep your opinions to yourself. Let people think you agree\\nwith them. And that’s not because you are a people pleaser\\nor  you  are  afraid  to  voice  your  opinion.  But  because  the\\nworld  is  full  of  clowns.  Not  everyone  has  an  open  mind  to\\naccept  that  diﬀerences  of  opinion  can  exist.  Don’t  go  out\\nthere  and  scream  your  perception.  Don’t  think  that  people\\nwill agree with you.\\n\\nIn  fact,  that’s  the  reason  most  people  just  follow  the\\ncrowd.  They  know  if  they  voice  their  opinions,  they  will  be\\nkicked out. This fear is one of the reasons why most people\\nare followers, not thinkers.\\n\\nMake  sure,  you  don’t  make  that  mistake.  Give  your\\nopinions only when speciﬁcally asked. Otherwise, keep your\\nthoughts inside you. I do it all the time. I know that people\\nfrom  me.  Their  upbringing,  educational\\nare  diﬀerent \\nbackground,  and  experiences  are  diﬀerent  from  mine.  So,\\nit’s  obvious  they  wouldn’t  have  similar  opinions.  I  don’t\\njudge  them  for  their  opinions  and  I  don’t  let  anyone  judge\\nfor  mine.  And  just  because  your  opinions  are  diﬀerent\\ndoesn’t mean they are superior. Maybe if you stay silent and\\nlisten  to  the  other  person,  you  will  get  to  know  a  new\\nperception.\\n\\nSo, go ahead and make a list of everything that you think\\nyou  are  not,  or  what  you  never  want  to  be.  For  example;\\nWhile  I  was  in  college,  almost  every  other  student  used  to\\ndrink. I never touched it even when my friends asked me to\\nat least try. Why? Because I knew I am not this and I never\\nwill.\\n\\n“If you compromise with your principles once, it\\nwill become your habit to cheat your principles and\\n\\n \\n\\x0cdo what’s cool.”\\n\\nI  am  not  saying  you  should  drink  or  should  not.  I  am\\nsaying I never wanted to try it. So I stood my ground. Now,\\nit’s your turn to stand tall on yours.\\n\\nThat  was  the  one  reason  I  was  often  misjudged  and  left\\nalone.  I didn’t  want  to  just  belong to  some group.  I wanted\\nto  be  with  people  who  align  with  my  values  and  principles.\\nThis is the thing about knowing what you don’t want. Once\\nyou  set  the  lines  clear  for  yourself,  you  stop  taking  the\\ngarbage in. You stop taking the bare minimum from people.\\nYou  stop  laughing  at  jokes  that  aren’t  funny  and  you  stop\\nsaying  yes  to  everything  because  now  you  know  what  you\\nare not, what you don’t want, and what you will never be. It\\nraises your standard. It makes you feel that you are not here\\nto  adjust  to  everyone  or  everything.  You  simply  learn  to\\nreject what you know you don’t want. It’s that simple. There\\nis no such thing as learning to say NO. All you need to do is\\nlearn  to  know  what  you  don’t  want.  Set  the  standards  high\\nand  if  people  cannot  climb  those  standards  for  you,  then\\nthey will automatically stay away from you. This is how you\\nattract good people and stay away from toxic ones. In fact,\\nyour  eyes  become  blind  to  those  who  are  toxic.  In  one\\nsimple glance, you can tell they don’t align with your values.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4 - The Love for Solitude\\n\\nWayne W. Dyer once said “You cannot be lonely if you\\nlike  the  person  you’re  alone  with.”  and  that  I  believe\\nshould be enough to close this part of the book.\\n\\nBut  you  are  reading  a  self-help  book  so  you  want  me  to\\nkeep  saying  something  until  you  are  forced  to  believe  that\\nsolitude  is  good.  Though,  I  am  not  going  to  do  it.  Do  you\\nknow why?\\n\\nBecause that’s our problem. We want others to make us\\nbelieve in something. Hold our hands and show us the path.\\nAnd  when  people  leave  us  in  between  the  journey,  we  feel\\nlost like it’s all dark and scary. What you don’t realize is that\\nyou  need  to  walk  alone  to  reach  where  you  want  to  go.\\nEveryone  has  diﬀerent  goals  so  they  cannot  take  the  same\\nroute  as  you.  You  will  meet  some  good/bad  people  on  the\\nway  but  eventually,  they  will  turn  the  other  way  to  move\\ntowards their journey. And in the end, you will be left alone.\\nThe choice would be yours, whether you want to stay on the\\nway  and  cry  and  scream  at  people  for  leaving  you  while\\nthey  enjoy  their  journey.  Or  do  you  want  to  keep  walking\\nand get closer to your dream destination? In both cases, you\\nwill be alone. But the choice of crying and seeing yourself as\\na  helpless  person  or  to  keep  walking  and  enjoying  the\\njourney will be in your hands.\\n\\nAfter  ﬁfth  grade,  I  never  stayed  in  any  school  for  longer\\nthan 2 years. I kept switching schools until college. Being an\\nintroverted  and  extremely  under-conﬁdent  child,  it  was\\nalready  quite  tough  for  me  to  make  friends.  And  when  I\\nwould  ﬁnally  make  one  friend  who  could  turn  into  my  best\\nfriend,  I  would  have  to  start  from  scratch  again.  I  had  a\\nreally  close  friend  in  high  school  who  is  now  married  but  I\\nhad  to  leave  her  because  I  changed  school.  Then  I  had\\nanother really close friend in +2 but then it was time for me\\nto leave my hometown and shift to another city for college.\\n\\n \\n\\x0cAnd  then  as  God  was  creating  a  perfect  illusion,  I  met  my\\nthen-best friend on the ﬁrst day of college who was also my\\nroommate.  For  4-5  months,  the  two  of  us  were  such  great\\nfriends  that  even  professors  knew  that  we  always  stayed\\ntogether.  And  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  I  felt  like  I  found  a  best\\nfriend. But then I got really sick and had to come back to my\\nhome  town  for  15  days.  When  I  went  back  after  15  days,  I\\nwas already replaced. I knew that now I no longer ﬁt in her\\ndeﬁnition  of  ‘fun.’  So,  boldly  I  asked  her  to  pick  either  her\\nnew friends or me. Well, you can imagine the rest.\\n\\nI was alone for almost 3-4 months back then.I met some\\nnew  people  after  this  4  month  gap  and  long  story  short,\\nthey became some of the most amazing people I ever met. I\\nmet  my  girl  gang  who  I  still  miss.  These  girls  made  me\\nunderstand that ‘women uplift each other and women need\\neach  other  more  than  they  need  men’  Society  tricked  us\\ninto  believing  that  women  are  women’s  biggest  enemy  but\\nhoney,  you  cannot  even  imagine  what  a  woman  can  do  for\\nanother woman.\\n\\nNow  back  to  my  point,  when  my  college  life  came  to  an\\nend and I came back to my hometown, obviously we had to\\nleave  each  other.  I  was  with  my  friends  for  a  short  period\\nbut leaving them felt like leaving a part of me (for a while).\\nWhen my college life ended, I thought distance cannot come\\nbetween  true  friendship.  This  is  what  social  media  gurus\\nsay, right?\\n\\nThe initial few months were great. My friends and I used\\nto connect every now and then to gossip about our college,\\nremember  the  stupid  things  we  used  to  do,  and  share  our\\ngeneral  life  updates.  It  was  going  well  until  after  a  few\\nmonths,  every  one  of  us  got  busy  with  our  work.  And  even\\nwhen we tried to take out time to have a call, we somehow\\nran  out  of  topics  to  talk  about.  Our  lives,  profession,  and\\nenvironment were now diﬀerent and so were our priorities.\\n\\nIt  was  in  those  moments  that  loneliness  started  hitting\\nme. And I know even though I have said that loneliness and\\n\\n\\x0cbeing  alone  are  two  diﬀerent  things  and  I  still  stand  by  my\\nwords. But it is also true that your heart misses people who\\nmade  you  feel  at  home  just  by  their  presence.  Their  stupid\\njokes,  their  gentle  touch,  their  inspiring  words,  and  their\\nhidden  care  and  love.  It  all  makes  you  miss  them.  Missing\\nthe  people  who  you  cannot  be  with  anymore.  And  realizing\\nthat  you  wouldn’t  be  able  to  meet  the  people  who  were  a\\npart of you creates loneliness.\\n\\nThough,  what  I  realized  is  that  people  are  on  and  oﬀ  in\\neveryone’s life. They come and go, for good or bad. In case\\nyou  didn’t  understand,  I  meant  that  after  watching  this\\ngreat web series and movies on friendship and romance, we\\nare just manipulated into believing that ‘there  is something\\ncalled forever.’ However,  when  your  own  friends  or  partner\\nleave  you,  you  feel  betrayed,  lonely,  and  incomplete.  You\\nand  I  have  nourished  a  belief  that  people  have  to  be\\navailable  for  us  24/7.  But  real  life  doesn’t  work  that  way.\\nPeople  aren’t  ambulances  who  can  be  available  to  you\\nwhenever  you  want.  They  have  got  their  own  shit  to  deal\\nwith. They have got a career to work for. A family to nurture.\\nA goal to achieve. And a few breaths to inhale in silence.\\n\\nAnd this was one of the harsh truths that I had to accept\\nwhen  my  college  life  came  to  an  end  and  I  had  to  say\\nGoodbye to my friends. Initially, I used to feel sad and lonely\\ntoo but later I realized ‘that is how things are going to be for\\nthe rest of our lives.’ This is the part of adulthood when you\\nhave to say Goodbye even if you don’t want to. This is part\\nof being an adult when you have to let go of people to get a\\nhold of your career. That’s why I said earlier that Loneliness\\nIs  a  Part  of  the  Journey.  I  am  not  saying  that  you  have  to\\nchoose  between  career  and  friendship.  But  it  happens\\nautomatically  that  you  wonder,  ‘How  did  my  friends  slip\\naway from my hands?’\\n\\nThat’s  the  bargain  of  making  a  career  and  living  your\\ndreams.  Yes,  there  are  some  people  who  are  lucky  enough\\nto have both but that seldom happens in reality and more in\\n\\n\\x0cmovies/books.  For  example;  One  of  my  favorite  series  is\\nFRIENDS but if you observe this series, all 6 friends hang out\\nwith  each  other  all  the  time.  They  are  always  sitting  in  a\\ncoﬀee shop but that’s not possible in reality. You have a job,\\ncareer,  studies,  and  a  lot  more  things  to  look  after.  You\\ncannot just sit around all the time.\\n\\nSo,  let’s  make  a  new  belief  or  rather  an  agreement  that\\n“you  cannot  expect  people  to  stay  forever.”  Not\\nbecause  they  are  bad  but  because  they  have  a  lot  to  deal\\nwith in their own lives and that’s a part of growing up. The\\nconcept  of  forever  is  just  a  fantasy  that  you  have  bought\\nfrom some random series. In our generation, forever means\\nfollowing  each  other  on  social  media  and  once  in  a  while\\ncommenting  on  each  other’s  posts  and  keeping  each  other\\nin  our  memory  lane.  That’s  it.  Other  than  this,  if  you  are\\nexpecting\\n\\nanything from anyone, you are just preparing yourself to\\nget  hurt.  So,  kill  your  expectations  of  other  people  and\\nrealize one simple truth,\\n\\n“You are on your OWN now. Except for YOU, no one\\n\\nis going to stay by your side forever. People cannot\\nbabysit you forever.”\\n\\nSo,  even  if  you  are  around  people  or  you  ﬁnd  good\\npeople in the future (like I had), know one thing: you cannot\\nbe dependent on anyone.\\n\\nYou  will  have  to  create  enough  space  in  your  heart  for\\nyourself  so  that  being  with  yourself  feels  safe  and  loved.\\nAnd  being  with  people  feels  like  a  bonus,  not  a  short-term\\npleasure or escape.\\n\\nSo, ask yourself what you want for yourself. If you chose\\nto keep walking then make one more choice - the choice of\\nloving  the  person  who  you  are  with  and  that  is  YOURSELF.\\nWhen you love yourself, you will view the journey as a treat.\\nAs  I  said  earlier,  it’s  liberating  to  be  with  yourself.  You  are\\n\\n\\x0cwith  just  one  mind,  one  voice,  one  type  of  opinion  and\\nperception.  You  wouldn’t  have  to  take  the  burden  of\\nbecoming  who  you  are  not  to  please  people  you  don’t  like\\njust to ﬁt in, just for them to hold your hands until the end.\\nWhen you know you can walk alone just as ﬁne, you will be\\nastonished  to  experience  such  simple  joys  of  life  that  your\\nsoul enjoys.\\n\\nI hope you understand what I mean. I am not asking you\\nto push people away. Never do that. It’s hard to ﬁnd people\\nwho truly love you. All I am asking is to not forget yourself in\\nthe noise of the world.\\n\\nThe  next  section  of  the  book  is  based  on  -  turning\\nsolitude  into  your  growth  period.  But  it  can  happen  when\\nyou start viewing your loneliness as solitude. As a privilege,\\nnot a curse. When you are ready to walk with yourself, let’s\\nlearn to walk toward your dream life. Shall we?\\n\\n\\x0cPart 2 Turning Solitude Into Growth\\n\\nPeriod\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5 - Practicing The ART of\\n\\nBeing Alone\\n\\n“Some people are alone because they don’t have friends\\nor family. Some people practice being alone because they\\nwant to stay connected to themselves.”\\n\\nGeorgia O’Keeﬀe was an American modernist artist, often\\ncalled  the  ‘mother  of  American  modernism.’  Born  on\\nNovember  15,  1887,  the  second  of  seven  children,  Georgia\\nTotto  O’Keeﬀe  grew  up  on  a  farm  near  Sun  Prairie,\\nWisconsin. By the time she graduated from high school, she\\nhad  determined  to  make  her  way  as  an  artist.  Georgia\\nstudied at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Students\\nLeague  in  New  York,  where  she  learned  the  techniques  of\\ntraditional  painting.  The  direction  of  her  artistic  practice\\nshifted  dramatically  four  years  later  when  she  studied  the\\nrevolutionary  ideas  of\\xa0   Arthur  Wesley  Dow.  Dow  oﬀered\\nO’Keeﬀe  an  alternative  to  established  ways  of  thinking\\nabout art. She experimented with abstraction for two years\\nwhile  she  taught  art  in  West  Texas.  Through  a  series  of\\nabstract  charcoal  drawings,  she  developed  a  personal\\nlanguage to better express her feelings and ideas.\\n\\nO’Keeﬀe  mailed  some  of  these  highly  abstract  drawings\\nto  a  friend  in  New  York  City.  Her  friend  showed  them  to\\xa0\\nAlfred  Stieglitz,  the  art  dealer  and  renowned  photographer,\\nwho  would  eventually  become  O’Keeﬀe’s  husband.  He\\nbecame the ﬁrst to exhibit her work, in 1916.\\n\\nBy  the  mid-1920s,  O’Keeﬀe  was  recognized  as  one  of\\nAmerica’s  most  important  and  successful  artists,  known  for\\nher  paintings  of  New  York  skyscrapers—an  essentially\\nAmerican  symbol  of  modernity—as  well  as  her  equally\\nradical depictions of ﬂowers.\\n\\nO’Keeﬀe  was  at  the  peak  of  her  career  when  she  found\\nherself restless in the city life of New York, craving to escape\\n\\n \\n\\x0cthe  crowds.  While  Stieglitz,  her  husband,  was  a  social\\nbutterﬂy,  O’Keeﬀe  preferred  being  alone.  She  always  said\\n‘There is a kind of freedom in being alone.’\\n\\nFinally, in 1929, after much deliberation, she left for New\\nMexico  for  the  very  ﬁrst  time.  This  became  the  ﬁrst  of  her\\nmany extended trips in the desert, where she spent months\\nwandering  alone,  living  in  tents,  with  nothing  but  her  art\\nsupplies for the company.\\n\\nIn 1934 O’Keeﬀe bought a piece of land on a ghost ranch\\nand permanently moved to the desert. Here she spent four\\nyears restoring the ranch and setting up her solitary abode.\\nHer  minimalist  house  with  a  view  of  the  Cerro  Paranal\\nmountains became her own little haven, where she lived up\\nto  almost  a  hundred  years  ‘deliciously  alone’,  in  blissful\\nsolitude, making art till her body allowed her.\\n\\nHer  art  and  the  inspiration  behind  it  were  simple  as  she\\nused  to  say,  \"I  had  to  create  an  equivalent  for  what  I\\nfelt about what I was looking at – not copy it.\"\\n\\nGeorgia  O’Keeﬀe  is  not  the  ﬁrst  nor  the  only  artist  who\\nfound inspiration in solitude. History, if you ﬂip the pages, is\\nﬁlled  with  examples  of  legendary  artists,  warriors,  and\\nwriters  who  found  their  hearts  speaking  to  them  directly\\nwhen  they  spent  time  with  themselves.  Much  like  Georgia,\\nNikola  Tesla  preferred  solitude  and  went  on  to  say,  “The\\nmind  is  sharper  and  keener  in  seclusion  and  uninterrupted\\nsolitude.  No  big  laboratory  is  needed  in  which  to  think.\\nOriginality  thrives  in  seclusion  free  of  outside  inﬂuences\\nbeating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that\\nis  the  secret  of  invention;  be  alone,  that  is  when  ideas  are\\nborn.  That  is  why  many  of  the  earthly  miracles  have  had\\ntheir genesis in humble surroundings.”\\n\\nVincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter\\nwho  became  one  of  the  most  inﬂuential  ﬁgures  in  Western\\nart  only  after  his  death.  He  created  over  2,100  artworks,\\nmany  of  which  while  living  in  solitude.  Vincent  often  felt\\nlonely but instead of crying over it or ﬁnding fake/degrading\\n\\n\\x0ccompany,  he  used  his  art  to  express  himself  and  his\\nexperiences  with  loneliness.  He  once  said,  “Though  I  am\\noften  in  the  depths  of  misery,  there  is  still  calmness,  pure\\nharmony, and music inside me.”\\n\\nThese  are  just  some  of  the  examples  of  the  greatest\\nartists  who  choose  to  be  alone  so  that  they  can  eliminate\\nthe  external  noise  which  takes  them  away  from  their  true\\nnature.  Cal  Newport  talks  about  ‘how  all  the  great  writers,\\nartists  and  inventors  choose  to  spend  time  with  no\\ndistractions  so  that  they  can  connect  with  something  deep\\nwithin themselves and create a true masterpiece.’\\n\\nThe irony is, where our generation is treating ‘solitude’ as\\nloneliness, something to escape and feel ashamed of, there\\nwas  a  time  in  history  when  all  the  great  minds  sought\\nsolitude  to  travel  inward.  Solitude  was  once  a  luxury  to\\nexperience the calmness of the world that lives inside us.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly believe that this cannot be random. The\\nsystem  around  is  designed  very  carefully  and  after  a  deep\\nanalysis  of  our  basic  human  nature.  We,  as  humans,  do\\nneed  other  humans  to  feel  safe  and  protected.  That’s  how\\nwe function. And all these giant companies (not to mention\\nsocial media platforms especially) are designed to keep our\\n‘need for validation’ as the focal point so that they can trap\\nus in the cycle of misery.\\n\\nThe life of Georgia O’Keeﬀe is living proof of how solitude\\nhelps us reach our greatest potential. Look around you and\\nyou will observe the people who are setting boundaries and\\nworking on their goals/dreams are the ones who don’t have\\na  large  group  of  friends.  They  are  the  ones  who  are  alone.\\nNot because they are miserable and pathetic. Because they\\nare choosing to leave the noise behind. And the people who\\nare  always  ready  for  a  party,  another  get-together,  or  just\\nseem  to  waste  time  scrolling  through  social  media  are  the\\nones who have zero goals with no real connection and a lot\\nof time to pass judgment on who is doing what.\\n\\n\\x0cIt  may  sound  a  little  judgemental  but  tell  me  if  it’s  not\\ntrue.  People  who  are  up  to  something,  people  who  are\\nworking towards their future or busy creating their art don’t\\nhave  time  to  feel  lonely.  Rather  they  crave  to  be  alone  so\\nthat they can ‘FOCUS.’\\n\\nFOCUS IS A NEW LUXURY.\\nIn a generation that is happy being distracted and easily\\nmanipulated, focus doesn’t come easy. And if you think that\\nI  am  exaggerating  then  tell  me  one  thing.  Most  people  are\\naddicted to social media and their mobile phones in general.\\nThey  all  want  to  know  ‘how  to  get  rid  of  mobile  addiction’\\nyet  the  very  next  day  or  week,  they  ﬁnd  themselves\\nswimming in the pool of endless posts and videos that have\\nnothing to oﬀer you.\\n\\nI mean WHY and HOW?\\nIf you, who is the master of your mind, want to get rid of\\nsocial media then why are you not able to? If you, who has a\\nmind, want to focus then why are you not able to?\\n\\nBecause  as \\n\\nit  seems,  YOU  ARE  NO  LONGER\\nCONTROLLING YOUR MIND. Your mind is now a device of\\nthese  giant  tech  companies  that  they  control  as  per  their\\nwish. I ﬁnd it so funny and sad at the same time that people\\nare actually searching on YouTube or reading books on ‘how\\nto be productive?’\\n\\nReally? Is that how helpless and powerless you are?\\nIf  you  really  wanted  to  be  productive  and  get  your  work\\ndone,  you  would  get  your  ass  on  your  chair  and  start\\nworking.  My  friend,  there  is  no  other  quick  hack  or\\ntechnique for  that.  Yet,  as  it’s  a generation of  fools, we are\\nalways  looking  for  quick  ﬁxes  and  hacks  to  improve  our\\nlives.\\n\\nYou  might  be  thinking  that  Renuka,  how  does  any  of  it\\n\\nrelate to practicing solitude?\\n\\nLet  me  tell  you  one  thing.  You  can  never  achieve\\nanything good in life if you keep following the rules of others\\n\\n\\x0cand  seek  guidance  from  people  who  don’t  know  the  ﬁrst\\nthing about you.\\n\\nYour real guidance is YOU. Your heart knows what\\nneeds to be done and your mind is capable enough to\\nﬁgure out ‘how.’\\n\\nBut  if  you  keep  ﬁlling  your  mind  with  the  thoughts  and\\nopinions  of  others,  you  will  end  up  becoming  and  thinking\\nlike them. There would not be a single shed of uniqueness in\\nyou. You will end up becoming like a copy of the people you\\nlisten to on social media and in real life.\\n\\nThat’s  why  they  say,  ‘You  are  the  average  of  the  ﬁve\\n\\npeople you spend the most time with.’\\n\\nMy question is pretty simple here. If you are the average\\nof  the  ﬁve  people  you  spend  the  most  time  with  then  how\\nwill  you  become  an  average  of  yourself  if  you  don’t  spend\\nany  time  with  yourself?  If  you  become  like  the  person  who\\nyou spend the most time with then does that mean you are\\ngoing away from your real self for you don’t spend any time\\nwith yourself?\\n\\nPerhaps, artists like Georgia O’Keeﬀe knew this from the\\nstart.  They  all  knew  that  in  order  to  create  real  art,  they\\nhave  to  become  REAL  to  themselves  ﬁrst.  Hence,  they\\nchoose solitude.\\n\\nWe  have  already  learned  why  loneliness  is  not  a  curse\\nand  how  we  were  manipulated  into  believing  so.  But  you\\nneed to learn that Solitude is the only way to create real art.\\nSure,  you  and  I  cannot  leave  everything  and  everyone\\nbehind  and  shift  to  Mexico.  But  you  and  I  can  consciously\\nchoose  to  spend  some  time  with  ourselves  so  that  we  can\\nbecome  more  like  ourselves.  At  least  we  can  touch  the\\nreﬂection  of  our  true  personality and  experience the  luxury\\nof our minds.\\n\\nLet’s ﬁrst learn how you can practice solitude (and why)\\n\\nand then how you can use your alone to grow yourself.\\n\\n\\x0c1. Digest, Reﬂect, and Reset\\n\\nOkay  weird  question  but  tell  me  honestly,  has  that  ever\\nhappened to you that someone presented your favorite food\\nand you ate more than your body could take? And then you\\nfelt so stuﬀed that even breathing became like a task. Now,\\nif  someone  asks  you  to  walk  10  km  in  such  a  situation,\\nwould you be able to?\\n\\nProbably not. And I am speaking this from experience.\\nSomething  similar  happens  with  our  brains.  Excessive\\neating can make you feel tired, sluggish, or exhausted. And\\nif  you  eat  junk  then  sometimes  it  even  causes  vomiting,\\nstomach  ache,  or  worse  food  poisoning.  All  in  all,  it’s  very\\nobvious  that  what  you  eat,  you  will  produce.  In  simple\\nwords, junk in, junk out. So, it’s safe to say that by eating a\\nburger,  pizza,  and  fries  every  day,  you  cannot  expect  to\\nbuild a healthy body, right?\\n\\nSo,  you  are  smart  enough  to  understand  this  much.\\n\\nOkay, good.\\n\\nI expect you also understand that you cannot force your\\nbody  to  eat  constantly  for  2  hours.  I  mean,  it’s  a  dumb\\nquestion but I am just making sure that we are on the same\\npage.  You  eat,  you  feel  stuﬀed  and  then  you  don’t  eat  for\\nanother 4-5 hours until you feel hungry again, right?\\n\\nWell,  then  why  do  you  treat  your  brain  like  a  dustbin?\\nWhy  do  you  keep  consuming  content  (either  through  social\\nmedia/videos/books) \\nit  all\\nconsistently  for  hours?  Why  do  you  expect  your  brain  to\\nwork  creatively  when  it’s  so  ﬁlled  with  garbage  that  even\\nthinking straight feels like a task beyond your capacity?\\n\\nlike  your  brain  can \\n\\ntake \\n\\nJust  as  eating  junk  food  doesn’t  give  you  abs  and  a\\nhealthy  body,  similarly,  consuming  junk-worthy  content\\nwouldn’t make you any smarter. And just as you don’t feed\\nyour  body  with  food  for  hours,  similarly,  you  cannot  feed\\nyour brain with information and knowledge or it will extract\\n\\n\\x0cevery  bit  of  mental  power  and  make  your  brain  sluggish  or\\ndrowsy.\\n\\nI  don’t  know  how  to  make  it  simpler  but  your  mind  will\\ngive  you  what  you  give  to  it.  Junk  in,  junk  out.  And  by\\nconsistently  feeding  your  brain  for  hours,  you  will  end  up\\ndestroying  your  basic  mental  capacity.  Just  as  your  body\\nneeds  the  time  to  digest  what  you  eat,  your  brain  also\\nneeds the time to digest what you consume.\\n\\nAnd that time is the period of ‘conscious solitude’ where\\nyou choose to sit alone to let your brain digest whatever you\\nconsumed without any disturbance or external noise. There\\nis  so  much  information  and  content  out  there,  so  much\\nadvice and hacks, and so\\n\\nmany  people  and  their  own  diﬀerent  opinions  and\\nperceptions that if you don’t put a break on it, you will end\\nup  drowning  in  this  vast  sea.  We  are  constantly  consuming\\ninformation  from  the  outside  world.  But  we  never  give  our\\nminds  enough  rest  to  digest  what  we  have  consumed.  You\\nare surrounded by so much information, opinions, and data\\nthat even you don’t know what’s entering in your mind. We\\nlisten  to  something  powerful  or  something  said  powerfully\\nand  start  believing  it  without  using  our  brains.  It  doesn’t\\nmatter  what  the  content  is,  positive  or  negative.  What\\nmatters \\nis  YOU  DON’T  THINK  ANYMORE.  YouTubers,\\nPodcasters,  Authors,  or  Social  media  inﬂuencers  are  also\\npeople,  not  God.  Hence,  it  is  not  essential  that  what  they\\nsay is correct or suitable for your life. Eliminate what doesn’t\\nmake  sense  to  you.  Don’t  just  consume  content  and  say,\\n‘Oh my god, what a video or what a podcast’\\n\\nTHINK BEFORE YOU LET ANY ADVICE OR THOUGHT TO SIT\\n\\nIN YOUR MIND.\\n\\nIf  you  never  leave  your  mind  alone  and  constantly  ﬁll  it\\nwith garbage and others’ opinions, you will be nothing but a\\ncollection of your external world. There is a world inside you\\ntoo  that  you  need  to  travel  and  explore.  Your  mind  has  a\\nunique thought process and opinions as well that you should\\n\\n\\x0cpay  attention  to.  Tell  me,  if  you  never  sit  alone  to  listen  to\\nthe  voice  inside  you,  how  will  you  ever  know  what  is  going\\non inside you?\\n\\nThe  thoughts  that  enter  your  mind  when  you  are  alone\\nand  disconnected  from  the  world  are  the  thoughts  that\\nactually  reﬂect  who  you  are,  what  matters  to  you,  and\\nwhat’s your thought process.\\n\\nSitting  alone  is  tough.  I  know.  Especially  for  people  who\\nhave  a  great  deal  of  practice  in  laughing  at  stupid  TikTok\\nvideos that wouldn’t matter after a second. You have trained\\nyour mind to live on cheap entertainment. You have trained\\nyour  mind  to  numb  itself  as  you  waste  another  2  hours\\nscrolling  social  media.  You  don’t  feel  tired  when  you  see\\nyour  mobile  screen  for  hours  but  you  feel  tired  when  it\\ncomes  to  studying,  learning  new  things,  or  working  on  the\\nreal  stuﬀ.  Then  you  feel  distracted.  Why?  Because  that’s\\nhow  things  are  designed.  You  don’t  need  to  focus  on\\nlaughing  at  stupid  jokes  you  see  on  social  media  or  be  lost\\namong trending videos. That’s why it’s easier to enjoy social\\nmedia.  And  that’s  the  same  reason  why  your  mental\\nmuscles are getting weaker.\\n\\n\"You and I are practicing every day to not practice\\n\\nfocus.\"\\n\\nRead that again.\\nAll I can say is, sitting alone will be tough initially. But it is\\nthe need of the hour as well. You need to give your brain the\\ntime  to  digest  what  you  consumed.  Reﬂect  on  what  is\\nimportant  and  delete  what’s  not.  So  that  there  is  enough\\nspace again to feed your brain again. You need to give your\\nmind  the  time  to  reset  and  let  it  be  alone  for  a  while  to\\ncreate  your  own  world  that  is  unique,  artistic,  and  known\\nonly to you. You need to choose to sit in solitude, feeling the\\nfreedom that comes with  your company, and  let  your mind\\ntake  some  rest  from  the  noise  of  the  external  world.\\n\\n\\x0cOtherwise,  as  I  said  earlier,  you  will  end  up  becoming  an\\naverage  of  your  surroundings.  The  time  you  spend  with\\nyourself  will  help  you  to  ﬁlter  out  the  garbage,  curate  your\\nown opinions, analyze your thoughts and study your beliefs.\\nIn simple words,\\n\\n“Detox your brain every day.”\\n\\n\\x0c2. The Art of Getting Bored\\n\\nWhen  I  was  starting  my  journey  as  a  writer,  I  used  to\\nwatch  and  read  the  interviews  of  famous  authors.  And  one\\nthing  was  common  in  all  of  them.  They  all  said  the  best\\nideas  come  into  their  mind  when  they  are  not  looking  for\\nthem  or  not  doing  anything  at  all.  It’s  not  just  the  authors\\nbut if you ask any creative or artistic person, you will get the\\nsame  answer.  And  I  always  thought  that  it  was  impossible\\nuntil it happened to me.\\n\\nWe  are  always  busy.  One  task  after  another.  One  email\\nafter  another.  One  video  after  another.  One  thought  after\\nanother.  The  cycle  never  ends.  We  never  take  a  pause  to\\nreﬂect  on  who  we  are  becoming,  what  we  are  losing,  what\\nwe  are  thinking,  or  what  our  thought  process  is.  When  you\\nare  just  taking  outside  information  without  thinking  about\\nwhat  you  are  consuming,  you  end  up  doing,  thinking,  and\\nbecoming  like  your  surroundings.  And  then  you  complain\\nabout not having creative ideas.\\n\\nWhen  I  started  spending  more  time  alone,  I  gave  my\\nmind  much-needed  rest  to  relax  and  recharge  while\\ndecluttering  the  unnecessary  information  my  mind  has\\nstored.  And  trust  me,  in  the  most  unexpected  moments,  I\\nstarted  getting  such  beautiful  ideas  that  I  never  thought\\nwere  possible  for  a  person  like  me  (I  used  to  think  I  am\\ndumb so…)\\n\\nIt  is  the  relaxed  mind  that  generates  more  ideas  than  a\\nstuﬀed  mind  which  is  so  full  that  it  might  throw  up  (in  the\\nform  of  stress).  If  you  keep  feeding  your  brain  with\\nsomething  all  the  time  then  you  are  leaving  no  room  for\\nyour  brain  to  digest  that  information.  It’s  proven  that  your\\nbrain  needs  time  to  process  that  information.  And  when\\nthere  is  no  gap,  it  all  becomes  a  mess  in  the  brain.  That’s\\nthe reason why some people feel tired all the time and why\\nthey  cannot  focus  and  why  creativity  seems  to  be  far  from\\ntheir reach.\\n\\n\\x0cIn a world ﬁlled with major stressors and to-do lists, it can\\nbe  diﬃcult  ﬁnding  time  to  just  do,  well,  absolutely  nothing.\\nAnd  this  is  the  biggest  reason  why  you  should  ﬁnd  some\\ntime  to  do  nothing.  In  Eat,  Pray,  and  Love  by  Elizabeth\\nGilbert,  she  introduces  an  Italian  concept:  Dolce  Far\\nNiente, ‘the sweetness of doing nothing.’\\n\\nDoing  nothing  means  doing  absolutely  nothing.  No\\nmobile or social media. No book or gossiping. Just you in the\\nmoment  with  no  hidden  purpose.  It  means  slowing  down,\\nwithout  hurling  your  mind  in  multiple  directions,  and  just\\nbeing. The sweetness of doing nothing or the art of getting\\nbored is somewhat similar to me. Our world is full of cheap\\nentertainment.  As  soon  as  you  feel  bored,  you  open  Netﬂix\\nor watch  a bunch  of  people dancing or doing weird acts  on\\nsocial  media.  All  in  all,  entertainment  is  at  your  ﬁngertips\\nand you access it at any time. But that is making you weak\\nand numb.\\n\\nWe wear busy as a badge of honor. If we are not working,\\nwe  are  doing  personal  development,  traveling,  being\\nproductive, starting businesses, learning, growing, creating,\\netc.\\n\\nAnd not being busy feels scary. For some people it means\\nthat they have to meet themselves face to face, for others,\\nit  means  not  feeling  worthy,  some  can’t  handle  not  being\\nperfect  and  useful.  When  we  have  free  time  it  just  doesn’t\\nfeel right.\\n\\nWe have learned to either silence or numb our brains. We\\neither  throw  short-term  pleasure  or  entertainment  or  a  big\\nto-do list on our faces so that we are always busy. But what\\nwe don’t realize is that ‘getting bored is an art.’\\n\\nIn  a  world  where  you  have  thousands  of  options  at  your\\nﬁngertips  to  enjoy,  it’s  an  art  to  know  how  to  feel\\ncompletely satisﬁed with doing nothing. Not only do you put\\na  full  stop  to  unnecessary  content  and  give  your  mind  the\\nmuch-needed relaxation when you consciously choose to do\\nnothing  but  you  also  learn  how  to  gain  self-control.  Most\\n\\n\\x0cpeople  go  back  to  their  toxic  ex  or  friends  because  they\\ncannot bear the\\n\\nthought  of  having  no  fun  in  life.  People  feel  boredom  so\\n\\nthey accept the bare minimum from others. But WHY?\\n\\nGetting  bored  is  more  like  a  form  of  meditation.  You  do\\nnothing. You sit alone with yourself. The only condition is to\\nbe  aware  of  your  mind.  Don’t  let  your  mind  slip  back  to\\nnegative  thinking  or  self-sabotaging.  You  learn  to  control\\nyour mind. You learn to control your desire to be with others.\\nYou  learn  to  control  your  desire  for  cheap  entertainment.\\nYou learn to not give up on short-term pleasure. This builds\\nself-control.  You  learn  how  to  be  bored  like  an  artist.  And\\nthen your mind rewards you with the most amazing creative\\nideas. The kind of ideas that you never expected.\\n\\nYou  cannot  get  out-of-the-world  ideas  when  you  are\\nspending all your time doing something and not letting your\\nbrain communicate with you.\\n\\nYou  wouldn’t  get  creative  ideas  just  on  your  ﬁrst  day  of\\npracticing the art of getting bored. The ﬁrst day will feel like\\na  total  waste  of  time  and  probably  you  will  curse  me.  Your\\nmind will play tricks on you reminding you why you are not\\nenough  or  something  bad  from  your  past  and  before  you\\nknow your time of getting bored will turn into overthinking.\\nBut that’s where you need to learn to be an artist.\\n\\nAs  you  practice  the  art  of  getting  bored,  you  leave  your\\nmind  free  to  wander  the  distinct  world  inside  you  while\\nbeing fully-completely-absolutely aware of where your mind\\nis  leading  you.  Just  when  you  realize  that  your  mind  is\\ndragging  you  down,  you  take  back  control  and  perhaps,\\nconsciously  choose  to  think  about  something  else  that\\nrelaxes  your  mind.  It’s  an  art  so  it  will  take  time.  But  not\\nonly will it make you more creative, but it will also teach you\\nhow  to  become  the  master  of  your  mind,  how  to  control\\nyour desires, and become more patient and calm like water.\\n\\n\\x0c3. Learn to Belong to Yourself:\\n\\n“Knowing how to belong to yourself is an art in a\\n\\nworld where everyone is ﬁnding their home in others.”\\n\\nI might sound a little rude but here is a truth about life,\\n‘Nothing stays forever.’\\nPeople  who  you  love  today  will  leave  you  or  you  might\\nhave  to  leave  them  or  they  might  change.  People  cannot\\nstay by your side 24/7. We have built a world where chasing\\nsuccess  requires  going  miles  away  from  family  and  friends.\\nShifting  to  a  new  city  for  a  new  job  or  leaving  home  for\\ncollege. Life and people change. Our priorities change.\\n\\nAnd in that case, if you never learned ‘how to belong\\nto yourself,’ you will end up feeling lonely every time\\nsomeone leaves you.\\n\\nYou  should  keep  your  heart  open  for  your  loved  ones  so\\nthey can walk in and make you feel loved. You should enjoy\\nthe  company  of  those  you  love.  But  you  should  also  learn\\n‘how to enjoy your own company.’\\n\\nFor  example;  One  of  my  friends  has  been \\n\\nin  a\\nrelationship  for  the  past  5  years.  Her  life  revolves  around\\nher  boyfriend.  Her  boyfriend  had  to  shift  to  another  city\\nwhich  is  about  a  12  hours  drive  away  from  her.  She  called\\nme  yesterday  and  said,  ‘I  don’t  know  what  to  do  without\\nhim. My life revolves around him and now that he is away, I\\nfeel so empty.’\\n\\nI will say the same thing to you that I said to her.\\n“Make your life like a garden where you have all types of\\npeople  and  interests  and  hobbies  so  that  you  always  have\\nsomething  or  someone  to  love  and  receive  love.  Have\\nfriends  you  adore,  enjoy  the  hobbies  you  are  passionate\\nabout, water your plants, and love your pets. Create things\\nand  build  that  relationship  around  you  that  keeps  you\\n\\n\\x0cexcited so that love is always around you in every form. Life\\nwill be more colorful that way”\\n\\nLearn to belong to yourself without feeling the need to be\\nwith  others.  Where  there  is  a  need,  there  is  a  settlement.\\nYou will settle down for less. But when you are satisﬁed with\\nyourself,  being  with  others  wouldn’t  come  out  of  your\\ndesperation but rather a real and genuine connection based\\non  love  and  care  for  one  another.  People  you  can  select\\nrather than living at the mercy of others to be selected.\\n\\nAnd  if  you  want  to  learn  how  to  be  satisﬁed  with  your\\nown  life  and  build  a  life  that  makes  you  feel  proud  of\\nyourself, let’s learn to use your alone time to turn into your\\ngrowth time. Shall we?\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6 - Turn Loneliness Into\\n\\nGrowth Period\\n\\nThe  other  day  I  was  reading  Garden  Spells  and  I  really\\nliked a quote from the book that says, “You are who you are,\\nwhether you like it or not, so why not like it?”\\n\\nI believe this quote holds true in all areas of our life.\\n\\nYou are alone, whether you like it or not, so why\\n\\nnot like it?\\n\\nAnd  if  you  cannot  ﬁnd  a  reason  to  like  it,  then  create\\nsome. You cannot expect life to throw reasons for you to be\\nhappy, cheerful, and successful. If you want something, you\\ngo get it.\\n\\nWhen I came back to my hometown after college, I knew\\nnothing. I didn’t know what my passion was and how I was\\ngoing  to  make  a  living  out  of  it.  I  was  alone,  desperate  to\\nachieve something without having any speciﬁc skill set with\\nsocietal  pressure  hanging  on  my  head  24/7  to  prove  my\\nworth  and  absolutely  no  one  to  talk  to  share  how  I  was\\nfeeling. During those few weeks, I was so consumed by self-\\ndoubts and pity.\\n\\nToday  when  I  am  writing  this  book,  if  I  look  back,  I  can\\nsee  that  the  only  person  who  was  missing  from  my\\nside was ME.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just the case with me but you as well.\\nWhen  it  comes  to  supporting  others,  we  stand  tall  with\\nthem.  When  it  comes  to  encouraging  others,  we  somehow\\ngive  a  perfect  speech  that  is  worthy  of  featuring  in  a\\nTedTalk.  When  it  comes  to  bringing  others  back  to  the\\npositive  side  of  life,  we  all  become  part-time  motivational\\nspeakers. However, when it’s time to support ourselves, we\\nsomehow  manage  to  leave  every  bit  of  ‘Gyan’  behind  and\\npush ourselves into a dark tunnel of self-sabotaging.\\n\\nWhy  you  and  I  don’t  have  enough  courage  to  stand  by\\nourselves? Why has no one taught us to ﬁrst be our friends?\\n\\n \\n\\x0cWell, if no one else, then today let me tell you how to be\\nyour friend  and  how you  can use  your alone  time  to  turn it\\ninto your growth period.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 7 - Make a New Best Bud\\n\\nI am in my 20s and as per the standard set by society, I\\nam supposed to just have fun, date random guys, dance to\\na song that I don’t understand, and call it LIVING LIFE.\\n\\nBut hey, I don’t want any of this. I am the kind of person\\nwho wants to be successful, have everything I set my mind\\non, and make money but at the same time, I wish to live a\\nslow life in a small village in Scotland. Quite amazing, right?\\nHowever, as I said, the  path  to  success is lonely  and\\nyou  can  either  choose  to  hang  out  with  your  friends  every\\nother day or you can be focused to achieve your goals. Your\\nfriends  may  not  have  similar  goals  as  you.  Or  when  you\\nwant  to  study  and  they  want  to  have  fun,  you  need  to\\nchoose one. Just to be clear, I didn’t have much of a choice\\nafter  coming  back  to  my  hometown  so  obviously,  I  settled\\nwith  the  latter  option.  I  decided  to  dedicate  myself  to  my\\ngoals. I decided to live for my dreams. I decided to turn my\\nimaginary  world  into  my  reality.  I  decided  to  make  friends\\nwith a friend who will last as long as I want. A friend who will\\nhelp me get closer to my goals. A friend who will make me\\nfeel important and conﬁdent every\\n\\nday. And I still have that friend with me at every stage of\\nlife. It’s tough to maintain the friendship but it’s worth every\\neﬀort. And I am asking you to become friends with my friend\\nas  well.  You  will  be  10x  happier  than  you  are  now.  Wanna\\nknow who that new friend is?\\n\\nI am asking you to become friends  with your  GOALS\\nand  dreams,  with  success  and  achievements.  I  am\\nasking  you  to  start  fresh  with  yourself.  I  am  asking  you  to\\nlook  at  your  alone  time  through  the  lens  of  a  highly\\nsuccessful  person  and  think  about  how  they  will  use  their\\ntime.  And  if  you  think  about  it,  it’s  neither  loneliness  nor\\nsolitude. It’s just time. How you view it will decide what kind\\n\\n \\n\\x0cof  label  to  put  on  it.  And  that  label  depends  on  your\\nmindset.\\n\\nSo,  yes  I  am  asking  you  to  change  your  mindset.\\nTransform  your  perception  of  loneliness.  Look  at  it  with  the\\nlens of your own future version who is highly successful and\\nexpecting  you  to  use  this  TIME  to  grow  yourself,  work  on\\nyour  dreams,  get  closer  to  your  dreamland  one  step  at  a\\ntime, and feel empowered as you think what all can you do\\nfor yourself in your alone time. It’s honestly that simple.\\n\\nJust  as  I  said  at  the  start  of  the  chapter,  being  alone  is\\nyour reality now, so why not change it into something where\\nyou  start  loving  your  solitude?  Why  don’t  you  turn  it  into\\nsomething that being alone feels like an\\n\\nopportunity,  a  luxury,  a  lifestyle  that  helps  you  level  up\\n\\nyour game?\\n\\nSo, yes, I am asking you to be friends with success.  I\\nam  asking  you  to  make  your  dreams  your  BEST  BUD.\\nStart  a  self-improvement  streak  with  your  new  friend  and\\nwith every step toward your goals, every small achievement\\nwill be like adding a new memory to your list.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd it may all sound inspiring to you, the question comes\\nback to HOW? How and where should you start? Well, once\\nyou are ready to be friends with success, ﬂip the page, and\\nlet’s  make  some  eﬀorts  to  get  the  attention  of  your  new\\nbuddy.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8 - Building a Dream Life\\n\\nPlan\\n\\n“If you don’t know where you want to go, how will you\\n\\never reach there?”\\n\\nEveryone  wants  to  become  successful.  Everyone  wants\\nto  live  their  dream  life.  Everyone  wishes  to  achieve\\nsomething  big.  Everyone  wants  to  leave  a  dent  in  the\\nuniverse.\\n\\nBut  if  I  ask  you  (or  you  ask  anyone  around  you),  what\\nsuccess  looks  like  to  you,  either  you  wouldn’t  have  an\\nanswer or you will say ‘Well, I want to make a lot of money,\\nlive  in  a  nice  luxurious  house,  give  my  parents  and  loved\\nones  a  comfortable  life,  travel  across  the  world  and  be\\nhappy.’\\n\\nHow  funny  and  sad  at  the  same  time.  If  all  of  us  are\\ndiﬀerent  then  how  can  our  dream  life  look  exactly  the\\nsame?\\n\\nBecause we are clowns. Oh, I am sorry if that sounded\\nharsh  but  I  meant  to  sound  a  little  truthful.  You  and  I  are\\nmanipulated into believing that success means a big house,\\nlots  of  money,  and  aesthetic  pictures  from  vacations.  And\\ndon’t  worry  I  am  not  one  of  those  people  who  will  tell  you\\nthat there is something\\n\\nwrong with dreaming about making money. No. Darling, I\\n\\nlove money.\\nBut!\\nThe  problem  is  you  and  I  are  behaving  like  clowns.  We\\nare  following  everything  that  people  in  power  want\\nto  make  us  do.  We  think  if  we  don’t  have  what  everyone\\nhas then we are missing out and our next goal should be to\\nachieve that one Chanel bag, one trip to Italy, one beautiful\\npartner  who  proposes  to  you  in  front  of  the  Eiﬀel  Tower,  a\\n\\n \\n\\x0ccute  baby  who  is  more  intelligent  than  anyone  else’s  and\\nmore bullshit like this.\\n\\nThe  problem  is  not  that  we  wish  to  have  certain  things.\\nThe  problem  is  we  wish  to  have  something  that  everyone\\nhas  so  that  we  don’t  seem  poor,  stupid,  or  weird.  The\\nproblem  is  that  we  are  making  our  lives  a  collection\\nof  cheap  dreams  that  everyone \\nimagines  and\\nmaterialistic  shit  that  everyone  else  possesses.  The\\nproblem  is  we  don’t  ask  ourselves  what  do  we  want  in  life,\\nwe try to copy the most successful person around us so that\\nwe can also become ‘successful.’\\n\\nAnd  I  call  all  of  it  a  well-designed  system  that  has\\nrobbed  us  of  our  basic  capability  to  think.  And  just  in\\ncase, you want the proof;\\n\\nYou  say  you  want  to  make  a  lot  of  money  to  become\\nsuccessful. Okay, darling. How much money do you need to\\nbe  able  to  come  to  peace  with  yourself?  How  much  money\\nis  enough  for  you  to  call  yourself  successful?  Do  you  have\\nany plans to get one percentage closer to that goal? If your\\ndream  is  to  make  $10,000/month  then  do  you  have  any\\nplans to make your ﬁrst $100? Or do you just think that one\\nday  magically  you  will  be  able  to  jump  from  zero  to\\n$10,000?  And  if  you  do  believe  in  this  magic,  do  you  have\\nany tricks or hacks to turn this magic into reality?\\n\\nAnd  you  know  what,  let’s  say  that  you  are  a  saint  and\\nyour  goal  is  not  to  make  money  but  to  ﬁnd  peace  and\\nmental  stillness  in  life.  Okay,  honey.  What  do  you  do  for\\nmental stability? Do you meditate and for how long? Do you\\nmeditate  once  in  a  while  just  to  curse  your  brain  for\\nthrowing  thousands  of  thoughts  at  you  or  do  you  meditate\\nevery  day  at  a  ﬁxed  time  whilst  following  a  ﬁxed\\nmantra/guidance?  Do  you  journal  or  do  you  just  overthink\\nabout how your life is a mess?\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cSee,  I  don’t  have  any  intention  to  make  you  feel  bad.  I\\nam just introducing you to YOUR REALITY. You are living in a\\nbubble  if  you  think  that  just  by  imagining  and  wishing  to\\nbecome  ‘successful’,  you  will  become  one,  that  too  when\\nyou don’t know what success means to you.\\n\\nThis  right  here  is  the  reason  why  you  need  to  be  alone.\\nEven if you have some good people around you and your life\\nis  all  happy  and  merry,  you  should  take  some  time\\nevery  day  to  be  ALONE  so  that  you  can  think\\nindependently  without  the \\ninﬂuence  of  anyone.\\nRemember what I said earlier in the ﬁrst part? When you are\\nalone, you are dealing with just one mind, one opinion, and\\none perspective. And since you have never been alone or at\\nleast  never  embraced  it,  you  don’t  know  what  you  think\\nabout  anything.  You  are  following  and  accepting  whatever\\nthe world throws at you.\\n\\nThis  is  one  of  the  reasons  I  started  spending  more  time\\nalone.  When  you  spend  time  alone,  it  is  only  then  you  will\\ncome  up  to  know  what  your  soul  truly  desires.  When  your\\nsoul  speaks  to  you,  it  speaks  with  no  manipulation,  hence\\nyou  get  to  know  what  you  truly  desire.  I  was  done  with\\nasking  people  to  guide  me.  I  was  one  of  those  people  who\\ncould  never  make  a  decision  on  my  own.  I  was  so\\nunderconﬁdent  about  my  opinions  that  if  I  had  two  choices\\nbefore  me,  I  would  spend  eternity  just  to  pick  one.  I  have\\nbeen  there.  I  always  sought  people  to  tell  me  what  was\\ngood for me.\\n\\nWhen  I  found  myself  alone  with  a  pool  of  decisions  that\\nwere  waiting  for  me,  I  realized  how  dependent  I  was.  I\\nrealized  that  I  don’t  trust  myself  enough  to  make  decisions\\nconﬁdently. And how I wish it was restricted to only me.\\n\\nThe  core  reason  why  we  follow  the  crowd  is  that  we\\ndon’t trust our decisions and choices.  We are afraid  at\\nevery  step  so  it  feels  safer  to  trust  the  crowd.  We  don’t\\nchoose  to  walk  on  a  new  path  because  it  seems  less\\ncrowded or rather alone.\\n\\n\\x0cBut  enough  is  enough.  Aren’t  you  tired  of  wishing  to  be\\nlike  everybody  else?  Aren’t  you  done  with  keeping  up  with\\nthis  race  of  looking  beautiful  where  beauty  has  such  a\\nvague yet same deﬁnition for all? Aren’t you exhausted with\\ntrying  to  achieve  success  when  you  aren’t  enjoying  the\\nprocess in your day-to-day life?\\n\\nAnd  most  importantly,  aren’t  you  afraid  that  you  will\\nwaste your entire life doing what everyone did just to realize\\nthat you never lived or did anything that you wanted?\\n\\nIf you take just one thing from this book, remember this,\\n\\n“Learn to deﬁne your deﬁnition of everything.\\nDon’t  make  your  life  a  wishlist  of  what  you  think\\n\\neveryone has.”\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cDeﬁne Your Deﬁnitions\\n“When you don’t know what you want then you want to\\n\\nhave everything that is glittery and shiny.”\\n\\nGod  was  kind  enough  to  bless  all  of  us  with  a  personal\\nbrain yet here we are. We have switched oﬀ our brains and\\nblindly follow what the world expects us to do. And then we\\nwonder, ‘why am I not happy even when I have everything I\\ndreamt  of?  Maybe  I  should  make  a  gratitude  list  just  like\\neveryone suggests to count my blessings and remind myself\\nhow lucky I am.’\\n\\nDarling, it’s time to switch on the button of your brain so\\n\\nthat your inner light can guide you.\\n\\nAnd how are we going to do that?\\nWell, simple enough. Just as we have practiced following\\nthe  rules  and  ﬁxed  deﬁnitions  of  society,  now  we  will  learn\\nto  create  our  personal  rules  and  deﬁnition  of  everything.  I\\nmean, it’s ironic how people always ﬁnd something to give a\\npersonal touch to, even coﬀee mugs, but forget about their\\nlife. But better late than never, right?\\n\\nA few days ago, I shared a post on my Instagram account\\n\\nabout ﬁnding joy in your day-to-day life. And\\n\\none  person  commented  that,  and  I  quote,  ‘still  I  don’t\\n\\nunderstand what should I do for my happiness’\\n\\nThis  shows  how  much  distance  we  have  grown  from\\nourselves.  In  the  race  of  ﬁnding  people,  we  lost\\nourselves.  And  if  you  are  expecting  that  I  can  give  you\\nsome  hacks  or  techniques  to  help  you  ﬁnd  your  happiness\\nor success then I am sorry, you are free to burn this book. I\\ncannot tell you what to do. I don’t know who you are, what’s\\nyour  history,  what  makes  your  heart  beat  faster  with\\nexcitement,  what  feels  joy  to  every  nerve  of  your  body.  I\\ndon’t know any of it. No one knows. And even if I tell you a\\nfew  hacks  then  maybe  you  will  give  this  book  5  stars  and\\nfeel motivated at the moment. But after a few days, you will\\nforget about it. Why? Because it didn’t come from you so it\\ndidn’t ﬁt in your life.\\n\\n\\x0cYou  need  to  sit  down  and  start  deﬁning  things  for\\nyourself.  Do  you  want  to  be  happy?  Great,  what  does\\nhappiness mean to you? Dig deeper and ﬁgure out what are\\nthe  things  that  make  you  happy  and  how  you  can  add  a\\nlittle  dose  of  happiness  to  your  day-to-day  life.  Don’t  ﬁnd\\nyour  happiness  on  YouTube  or  in  any  book.  Find  it  in  your\\nheart.  Do  you  want  to  be  successful?  Fantastic.  Now  ask\\nyourself  what  does  success  mean  to  me?  What  is  your\\ndeﬁnition  of  success  and  how  do  you  imagine  living  your\\nsuccessful  life?  Are  you  successful  professionally  or  do  you\\nwant success  in  all  areas  of  your life?  Let your deﬁnition  of\\nsuccess  be  your  compass.  You  cannot  build  your  life  by\\nwalking  in  someone  else’s  footprints.  Your  life  is  your\\ntreasure.  Your  life  belongs  in  your  hands.  You  should  take\\ncharge and start deﬁning everything for yourself. Enough of\\nliving like a slave who blindly follows everything. You might\\nnot  be  the  actual  king/queen  of  the  world  but  your  life\\ndepends  on  your  actions  so  act  like  you  OWN  it.  Take  your\\nown  decisions.  Build  your  deﬁnition  of  everything.  Think\\nbefore you accept anything from society. Use the brain that\\nGod  has  blessed  you  with.  Look  within  and  ﬁnd  your  true\\nguidance. It’s time you become the OWNER of your life. It’s\\ntime you give a personalized touch to your life. And it starts\\nnow.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9 - The Action Plan\\n\\nYou  cannot  build  your  dream  life  until  you  don’t  know\\nwhat  you  don’t  like  about  your  life  right  now.  You  want  to\\nchange  your  life.  Well,  darling  everyone  does.  But  the  big\\nquestion is WHY?\\n\\nCan you give me 2 reasons why you want to change your\\nlife? What is something you hate about yourself or your life\\nthat is itching you to change your life?\\n\\nIf  you  cannot  come  up  with  2  strong  reasons  then  all  of\\nthis will just feel like a motivational speech to you which you\\nwill forget in the next 2 days.\\n\\nWithout  knowing  what  you  want  to  change,  what\\n\\nwill you work towards to change?\\n\\nYou need to sit down and make a conscious list of ‘what\\nare some of the things you don’t like in yourself or your life.’\\nKnowing  what needs  to  be changed is the  ﬁrst  step  toward\\nyour  dream  life.  It’s  obvious  that  your  dream  life  looks\\ndiﬀerent than your current life. That’s why we call it ‘dream\\nlife’  so  ask  yourself  what  is  the  diﬀerence  between  your\\ndream  life  and  your  current  life.  Not  only  the  professional\\ndiﬀerence  but  dig  deeper  and  analyze  diﬀerences  in  each\\narea  of  your  life.  When  I  say  each  area,  I  mean  personal,\\nprofessional, emotional,\\n\\nand  mental  state  diﬀerences.  When  I  say  each  area  of\\nyour life, I mean what your dream day-to-day life looks like.\\nIt’s  not  a  sudden  magical  ONE-DAY  thing.  To  be  able  to\\ncreate  your  dream  life  ONE  DAY,  you  will  have  to  act\\nlike your dream version every day. Read that again until\\nit sinks deep within your soul.\\n\\nLife doesn’t change one day magically, YOU\\n\\nCHANGE HOW YOU LIVE EVERY DAY.\\n\\nSo, let me say it again,\\n\\n \\n\\x0cTake  a  pause.  Sit  down  at  a  quiet  place.  Take  a  piece  of\\npaper and write down 5 things that you don’t like in your life\\nright  now.  Whether  it’s  your  current  job  or  your  sleeping\\nschedule.  No  one  is  coming  to  make  that  list  for  you.  You\\nneed to do that for yourself TODAY or wait until you are 70\\nto regret the life you lived.\\n\\nYou  cannot  become  the  person  of  your  dreams  if  you\\ndon’t imagine what your dream version looks like and if you\\ndon’t know what is wrong with your current version.\\n\\nAnd  let  me  tell  you  a  secret.  It’s  okay  to  be  harsh  on\\nyourself sometimes. Because extreme self-love can take you\\naway  from  reality,  you  will  start  living  in  an  imaginary\\nbubble.  We  don’t  want  that.  We  want  to  love  who  we  are\\nand  be  excited  about  who  we  are  in  the  process  of\\nbecoming.\\n\\nSo, be honest with yourself. Don’t pretend that ‘ohh, I am\\nthe  perfect  person  and  there  is  nothing  wrong  in  my  life.’\\nNope,  darling.  That’s  toxic  self-love.  Your  deeper  inner  self\\nknows what you are capable of and how you are living less\\nthan your real potential. This gap creates self-loathing. And\\nthis  gap  can  be  ﬁlled  by  starting  to  become  honest  with\\nourselves.\\n\\n\\x0cBe Honest With Yourself\\nBefore  you  demand  anything  from  others,  learn  to  be\\nhonest  with  yourself.  Have  the  courage  to  accept  that  you\\nwere  the  one  killing  all  your  dreams.  Stand  tall  against  the\\nlies  your  brain  might  want  to  throw  at  you.  You  will  meet\\nenough  people  in  your  life  who  will  say  one  thing  but  their\\nactions  won\\'t  match.  You  will  meet  a  lot  of  people  who  are\\ngoing  to  lie  to  you.  While  you  cannot  control  how  others\\ntreat  you,  you  can  learn  to  be  honest  with  yourself.  Deep\\ndown  you  always  know  what\\'s  best  for  you,  you  can  sense\\nwhen  to  leave  a  person  because  you  are  just  being  used,\\nyou  realize  when  you  did  wrong  and  when  you  were\\nwronged yet just stay in your comfort zone and keep things\\nas they are, your brain will play tricks on you. You will make\\ngreat excuses to convince yourself not to start working, give\\na  person  another  chance,  or  keep  eating  junk  food  until\\nMonday.  That\\'s  because  honesty  with  yourself  is  the\\ntoughest thing. You get to live your worst fears and are left\\nwith  no  option  but  to  work  to  improve  things.  Yet  honesty\\nwith  yourself  will  make  your  life  way  more  satisfying.  You\\nwill be happy knowing you did what was best for you. That\\'s\\nwhere self-satisfaction starts.\\n\\n\\x0cStep 1: The Power of One Thing\\n\\nOne  of  the  biggest  mistakes  we  make  while  trying  to\\n\\nimprove ourselves is that we focus on everything at once.\\n\\nWe  try  to  hit  the  gym  every  day,  make  a  gratitude  list\\nevery day, eat healthy every day, and the like. And focusing\\non  everything  at  once  drags  us  down  to  a  level  where  we\\nﬁnd  ourselves  giving  up  on  everything  and  later  accusing\\nourselves  of  being  a  failure.  You  cannot  change  everything\\nat once. And if you try to, you will just burn yourself. You will\\nmake  the  journey  toxic  and  suﬀocating  for  yourself.  And\\neven  after  working  so  hard,  when  you  don’t  get  results  in\\nany of  the  areas,  you  just  give up  on everything.  And what\\ndoes  that  do?  It  lowers  your  self-respect.  You  start  thinking\\nthat you can never achieve anything good in life.\\n\\nThe catch is to focus on one thing at a time.\\nWhy?\\nBecause  changing  one  thing  in  your  routine  is  easier.  It\\neasily sinks in. And when you start seeing the result in one\\narea,  not  only  do  you  feel  happy  but  your  self-respect\\nincreases  too.  You  get  the  conﬁdence  for  trying  to  improve\\nmore things in your life.\\n\\nFor example; In 2020, I resigned from my job in the hope\\nthat I will become a successful freelancer. I tried and failed.\\nFor months, I didn’t get a single client. I was depressed and\\nhad  no  means  to  pay  my  bills.  That  was  the  time  when  all\\nmy  college  mates  were  earning  great  money,  having\\nvacations,  and  buying  stuﬀ  with  their  own  money.  I  was\\njealous  and  I  just  wanted  to  prove  to  myself  that  I  am\\nmoving forward.\\n\\nSo,  I  started  writing  on  Medium  which  is  a  platform  for\\nwriters. I didn’t have any hopes from Medium. I just wanted\\nto  prove  to  myself  that  I  am  doing  something  *at  least.*  I\\nhad  the  goal  of  writing  one  article  every  day.  10  months\\nlater,  I  had  10,000  followers.  And  that  wasn’t  enough.  I\\n\\n \\n\\x0creceived  so  much  from  my  audience  that  it  boosted  my\\nconﬁdence.  I  started  viewing  myself  as  a  loved  writer.  I\\nalways believed in the power of words but after receiving so\\nmuch love on Medium, I started believing in the power of MY\\nwords. And that’s how I ended up writing my ﬁrst book, “The\\nWounds of My Words.” It still feels like a dream. An illusion.\\nIf someone had told my 10-year-old version that I will be an\\nauthor  one  day,  my  little  version  would  have  laughed.  In\\nfact, if someone had told me in 2020 that I will be an author\\none day, I would have become even\\n\\nmore depressed that you are making fun of my situation.\\n\\nI didn’t consider myself a good writer. But\\n\\nnow,  oh  God,  I  cannot  believe  I  am  writing  my  second\\n\\nbook.\\n\\nIt  all  happened  because  I  made  one  decision  two  years\\nback.  And  it  wasn’t  just  a  decision.  It  was  an  action.  One\\naction  every  day  for  10  months  transformed  me  from  an\\nunder conﬁdent writer to a loved author.\\n\\nI  want  you  to  do  the  same.  Forget  about  big  sudden\\nchanges.  Forget  the  hope  of  magic.  Take  out  that  list  you\\nmade  earlier  (about  what  you  don’t  like  in  your  life  right\\nnow) and pick ONE BIG ISSUE from that list.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by one big issue?\\nWell,  back  in  2020,  a  lot  of  things  were  going  wrong  in\\nmy life. I wasn’t in good shape. I had skin allergies all over\\nmy body. I didn’t have any idea where my career was going.\\nAnd all of it dragged my mental health down. See, you need\\nto understand one important thing here.\\n\\nPeople  will  ask  you  to  work  on  your  mental  health  as  if\\nit’s homework from your school teacher. Your mental health\\nis  a  result  of  the  current  state  of  your  life.  If  something  is\\ngoing wrong in your life then mentally you will feel stressed,\\ndepressed,  or  anxious.  The  bigger  the  issue,  the  more\\nstressed you will feel. In my case,\\n\\nmy  career  was  my  biggest  concern.  My  second  job  was\\nquite  toxic  and  my  boss  used  to  yell  at  me  every  now  and\\n\\n\\x0cthen. She used to say that I can never make it as a writer. I\\nwas  doing  the  work  of  an  intern  there.  And  when  I  left  my\\njob  in  the  hope  of  a  brighter  future  just  to  ﬁnd  myself\\nstruggling to get clients, my boss’s words started ringing in\\nmy  head  like  an  alarm.  I  started  believing  her  words  as\\ntruth. I started questioning my worth. And all of it made me\\ndepressed.\\n\\nAfter  reading  over  200  books,  if  there  is  anything  that  I\\nhave  understood,  its  -  action  is  the  cure  of  almost\\neverything.\\n\\nSo,  I  decided  to  jump  on  Medium.  Now,  you  know  how\\n\\nthe rest of it goes.\\n\\nYou  will  ﬁnd  a  lot  of  ﬂaws  in  how  you  are  living  today.\\nThere  might  be  a  bunch  of  things  that  you  don’t  like  about\\nyour  life  at  the  moment.  But  you  need  to  understand  that\\nyou are not a magician. You cannot make everything work at\\nonce. You need to become an essentialist here.\\n\\nChoose  the  ONE  BIGGEST  ISSUE\\xa0   you  are  facing  in  your\\nlife  right  now.  What  is  that  ONE  thing  which  keeps  pulling\\nyou down? What is that one area of your life that makes you\\nfeel anxious and stressed? What is that\\n\\none  aspect  of  your  life  that  makes  you  feel  stuck  in  one\\n\\nplace?\\n\\nIdentify  that  ONE  BIG  ISSUE.  In  fact,  this  one  big  issue\\ncan be the reason why you don’t like to be alone. You know\\nthat  as  soon  as  you  are  alone,  your  mind  will  send  you\\nnotiﬁcations  of  what’s  wrong  in  your  life.  You  know  that\\nwhen  you  are  with  yourself  with  nothing  to  do,  your  mind\\nwill pull you back reminding you that your life sucks.\\n\\nYou will feel the itch to change and improve everything at\\nonce.  But  remember  that  you  are  a  human.  You  cannot\\nfocus  on  multiple  things  at  once  with  similar  eﬃciency.\\nWhen  you  are  focused  on  improving  one  thing,  not  only  it\\nbecomes  easier  to  measure  your  performance  but  you  also\\nfeel  excited.  You  don’t  feel  the  pressure  of  changing  your\\nworld in one day.\\n\\n\\x0cNow, I would suggest you close the book for a while, and\\ntake  some  time  to  identify  that  ONE  BIG  ISSUE  because\\nnext, we will discuss how you can work on that one area.\\n\\nStep 2: ONE BIG ACTION\\n\\nAfter  deciding  which  area  of  your  life  needs  more\\nattention,  it’s  time  to  take  ACTION.  But  the  question  is\\nwhere  to  start.  Most  people  make  the  mistake  of  randomly\\nstarting  out  of  motivation  and  by  the  next  week,  they  feel\\nclueless. It used to happen to me all the time. In the past, I\\ntried  to  adopt  a  healthier  lifestyle.  I  would  feel  motivated\\nand  decide  ‘You  know  what,  I  am  gonna  become  healthier\\nthis year.’\\n\\nWell,  in  less  than  a  week,  I  would  ﬁnd  myself  stuﬃng\\nfries and pizza in my mouth whilst watching a hot romantic\\nmovie on Netﬂix.\\n\\nBut as I shared earlier, when I started writing on Medium,\\nI  had  just  one  goal.  And  that  goal  was  based  on  ACTION.\\nFrom the very ﬁrst day, I was clear. I even wrote this on my\\n\\n \\n\\x0cWhatsapp group  (where only I  am  added. It’s  a great  hack.\\nMake a group only for yourself and send yourself messages.\\nMessages  that  you  would  like  to  receive  from  others.\\nMessages  that  you  can  send  to  your  current  self  to  calm\\ndown  and  think  straight  or  maybe  a  few  things  as  a\\nreminder) that my goal is to write one article every day. And\\nI never made any Excel sheet or bought any cute templates\\nor  any  aesthetic  looking  journal  to  track  my  progress.  Do\\nyou know WHY?\\n\\nBecause  I  didn’t  overburden  myself.  How  tough  is  it  to\\ntrack one ACTION? One article every day. Either I wrote or I\\ndidn’t. Simple, right?\\n\\nYou need to understand that setting big goals that sound\\ncool  and  energetic  is  ﬁne.  It  shows  your  enthusiasm  but  it\\nalso  represents  that  you  are  out  of  your  mind.  People  set\\ngoals  all  the  time.  They  keep  making  giant  promises  to\\nthemselves only to make excuses in the end. And then they\\nexpect  other  people  to  stay  and  fulﬁll  their  promises.  God,\\nwe are kidding ourselves.\\n\\nI  want  you  to  take  a  breath,  get  patient,  and  focus  on\\nwhat  I  am  saying.  This  one  thing  will  seriously  change  the\\nway  you  look  at  your  goals  and  your  working  system.\\nInstead  of  setting  vague  goals.  Focus  on  setting  ACTION\\nGOALS.\\n\\n\\x0cWhat Are Action Goals?\\nAction  goals  mean  you  know  what  you  will  be  doing  to\\nachieve  your  dream  life.  Action  goal  deﬁnes  clear-cut  what\\nyou are supposed to do every day to get one step closer to\\nyour destination.\\n\\nWhen I set an action goal, I made it clear that my target\\nis  to  WRITE,  which  is  an  action,  every  day,  which  deﬁnes\\nhow often am I supposed to take the action.\\n\\nNow,  it’s  your  turn.  Again,  don’t  overwork  yourself.  Take\\nout  a  piece  of  paper  and  write  in  front  of  that  BIG  ISSUE,\\nONE  ACTION  GOAL.  Yes,  make  it  clear  enough  for  yourself\\nwhat’s  the  one  action  you  will  perform  every  day  to  get\\ncloser to your destination. And then no matter what, DO IT.\\n\\n\\x0cStep 3:\\xa0 Know Your Nature & Sync\\n\\nYour Activities\\n\\nOne of the basic things about human nature is, the more\\nyou  force  yourself  into  doing  something,  the  more  you  will\\nfeel low and depressed. Like it’s imposed on you.\\n\\nIn  the  past  whenever  I  had  tried  to  follow  great  habits\\nand cute-looking routines, I always failed. One of the habits\\nthat  I  always  wanted  to  adopt  was  waking  up  at  5  AM.  I\\nwholeheartedly believe there are tons of beneﬁts to waking\\nup  early.  I  even  read  Robin  Sharma’s  book  ‘The  5  AM  Club’\\nand  hands  down,  what  an  amazing  book.  Then  I  also  read\\n‘The Miracle Morning’  and  it  was  a  good  book.  I  watched  a\\nlot of YouTube videos as well on ‘how to wake up early’ and\\nother  creator\\'s\\'  ‘early morning  routine’  just  so  I  could  learn\\nto wake up early.\\n\\nBut  nothing  worked  for  me.  I  tried  and  failed.  Multiple\\n\\ntimes. My mom even calls me a ‘sleeping beauty.’\\n\\nThough the big question was WHY? Why did I try so hard\\nto  wake  up  early?  And  not  just  that,  I  used  to  curse  myself\\nfor  sleeping  till  late.  But  then  I  came  across  the  concept  of\\nthe body clock that diﬀers for each individual. In brief, your\\nbiological clock controls\\n\\nwhen you work the best. In simple words, not everyone is\\nmeant to be an early riser. Some people work best at night\\nwhile others prefer the morning time.\\n\\nAnd after  studying more about  the  concept  and  my own\\nbody,  I  realized  that  I  am  not  an  early  riser.  I  work  best\\nduring  the  night.  I  feel  most  creative  at  night  time.  And  if\\nmy goal was to get as much as done then why the hell was I\\nforcing  myself  to  wake  up  early?  Now  that  I  know  when  I\\nwork  best,  instead  of  cursing  myself  to  follow  the  most\\nfollowed routine by everyone else, I work when I feel like it.\\n\\nNow, why am I telling you this?\\n\\n \\n\\x0cThe  thing  is,  everyone  starts  self-improvement  projects.\\nEveryone  sets  goals.  But  the  majority  of  them  give  up.  I\\nused to give up as well. And I am sure in the past you must\\nhave given up on your goals as well. Why?\\n\\nBecause  it  starts  feeling  like  a  punishment  after  a  few\\ndays.  Initially,  when  we  are  working  on  the  dose  of\\nmotivation,  it  feels  good.  But  as  soon  as  motivation\\nevaporates, we give up. It feels exhausting, not exciting.\\n\\nit \\n\\nAll  of \\n\\nis  because  everyone  is  diﬀerent  and\\neveryone  likes  to  work  diﬀerently.  If  you  force\\nyourself  to  apply  someone  else’s  solutions,  you  will\\nlose the grip on your own life.\\n\\nWorking  on  our  goals  should  be  fun  and  exciting,  not\\nexhausting. Now to make it fun, we need to allow ourselves\\nto be ﬂexible. To free ourselves from traditional methods of\\nachieving goals. You need to dig in and ﬁnd out how you like\\nto  work  and  what  time  you  work  the  best.  You  must  feel\\nempowered whenever you take action on your goals.\\n\\nOne of my goals for 2023 is to focus on my journey as an\\nauthor. My big action goal was to write 10 pages every day. I\\ndon’t  sit  down  to  write  ﬁrst  thing  in  the  morning  as  most\\npeople  recommend.  Because  in  my  opinion,  you  cannot\\nwrite  if  you  don’t  want  to.  Writing,  to  me,  is  not  about  a\\nroutine but music to my heart. You cannot force yourself to\\nlisten  to  music.  So  instead  of  forcing  myself  to  write  ﬁrst\\nthing  in  the  morning,  I  write  whenever  I  feel  like  it.  That’s\\nhow it’s more fun to me.\\n\\nAnother example from my life would be, I always wanted\\nto stay ﬁt. I used to set the target of hitting the gym every\\nday and imagine myself getting in shape. But it never lasted\\nfor more than a week or two. So this\\n\\nyear, I set the goal to move my body every day but how I\\ndo it is on me not on what is cool and famous. I sometimes\\nprefer  to  dance  and  do  yoga  while  other  times,  I  just  wake\\n\\n \\n\\x0cup  early and go  cycling  for  10-12 km.  That’s  how I want to\\nwork.\\n\\nDo you see the diﬀerence?\\nI am moving  towards my goals every day but  in  a way  I\\nwant.  I  am  not  forcing  myself  to  do  a  certain  thing  in  a\\ncertain way. It’s my life. And I will achieve my goals in ways I\\nprefer comfortable in.\\n\\nAnd I would suggest you do the same. Instead of making\\nthings a burden for you, make things fun. Shake it up a\\nbit.  Focus  on  what  you  would  like  to  do  today  and\\nhow can you make even the mundane things fun?\\n\\nThe point is you don’t remain the same. You evolve. Your\\npreference  changes  and  your  working  style  changes.  And\\nwhat  worked  for  you  yesterday  may  not  work  for  you\\ntomorrow.\\n\\nNow  go  ahead,  and  summarize  this  chapter  to  set  your\\nfor  yourself  and  start  your  self-\\n\\nactionable  goals \\nimprovement streak TODAY.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10 - Make Your Alone Time\\n\\nAddictive\\n\\nWhy  do  you  love  to  spend  time  with  people  you  love\\n\\nwhile hate being around certain people?\\n\\nBecause  time  ﬂies  with  the  people  you  love  and  the\\npeople  who  love  you.  They  make  their  presence  addictive\\nfor you. They share so much love, compassion, laughter and\\nsecrets,  and  hugs  that  you  look  forward  to  these  things,\\ndon’t  you?  And  when  you  are  not  with  them,  you  miss  all\\nthese sweet little things.\\n\\nSimilarly,  you  don’t  like  being  around  certain  people\\nbecause, with them, time becomes the devil. They don’t get\\nyou.  They have  nothing  to  oﬀer  you,  no love  or any similar\\ninterest.\\n\\nIf you didn’t get what I am trying to say here, let me put\\nit straightforwardly. The reason you don’t like spending time\\nwith yourself is that your relationship with yourself falls into\\nthe second category. You have nothing to oﬀer yourself,\\nno love or no joy.\\n\\nAs  I  shared,  when  I  came  back  to  my  hometown,  my\\nschool  friends  didn’t  want  to  keep  in  touch  with  me.\\nHowever, now they message me to ask me if I would like to\\nhang out. I don’t know what changed. But now, I don’t want\\nto go with them. I feel so comfortable and\\n\\nhappy and peaceful at my home doing my own stuﬀ that\\nI  don’t  have  any  interest  in  becoming  someone’s  doll.  Old\\nRenuka would have gone but not me. Why?\\n\\nBecause  I  have  more  interesting  things  to  do.  I  have\\ncreated  other  ways  to  entertain  myself.  I  have  transformed\\nmy alone time from miserable to ADDICTIVE. And I want you\\nto do something similar as well.\\n\\nHow?\\nLet’s discuss that.\\n\\n \\n\\x0c1. Create Multiple Sources of Joy\\n\\nThere  are  a  lot  of  wishes  that  are  buried  in  your  heart.\\nThings that you always wanted to try but you never get the\\ntime  for.  Any  speciﬁc  hobby  or  skill  that  you  wanted  to\\nadopt but you never had ‘free time’ except you always had\\nan  abundance  of  time  to  scroll  through  social  media  or\\nwatch  Netﬂix  on  loop.  You  just  didn’t  have  the  time  to  DO\\nwhat your heart carved.\\n\\nAs children, we were so excited to try new things or play\\nnew  games  without  worrying  about  perfection  or\\nproductivity. But as we started becoming an adult, a load of\\nresponsibility,  the  burden  of  becoming  successful,  and  the\\nneed  to  prove  our  worth  eliminated  every  single  joy  from\\nour lives. Some hobbies used to set our hearts on ﬁre which\\ntoday  are  not  a  part  of  our  lives.  There  were  picnic  spots\\nthat  we  used  to  feel  excited  about  but  today  we  sit  on  our\\nsofa  all  day  just  to  complain  we  have  nowhere  to  go.  How\\ndid that happen?\\n\\nPerhaps,  as  kids,  we  were  ﬁne  with  exploring  the  little\\njoys  of  life.  Kids  ﬁnd  a  way  to  entertain  themselves.  That’s\\nwhy they are happiest at almost all times. They know how to\\nmake  themselves  happy.  However,  adults  are  mostly  sad.\\nBecause  we  expect  others  to  come  and  entertain  us.  And\\nwhen no one comes, we end up feeling lonely.\\n\\nIf I ask you, what is the one thing you do every day\\n\\nto make yourself happy, what would you say?\\n\\nHard  to  answer.  I  know,  I  have  been  there  as  well.  It’s\\neasier  to  expect  the  world  to  be  our  cheerleader.  But  it’s\\nhard  to  look  in  the  mirror  and  question  what  we  do  for\\nourselves. No wonder, we feel lonely.\\n\\nBut hey, I am not your mom so it’s not my job to yell at\\n\\nyou.\\n\\nI understand that being an adult is not easy. It’s just a lot.\\nYou have to take care of everything all at once whilst taking\\n\\n \\n\\x0ccare of  yourself  too.  But the  thing is,  it doesn\\'t  matter  how\\nhard you try, how much you work, and how overworked you\\nfeel at the end of the day. What matters is do you even do\\none  single  task  in  your  day  that  makes  you  feel  satisﬁed?\\nWe don\\'t feel exhausted because we try too hard. We\\nfeel exhausted because we do too little of what truly\\nmakes  us  happy.  So  perhaps,  if  you  do  even  just  ONE\\nthing  intentionally  that  makes  you  feel  connected  to\\nyourself, to your inner child then life will start feeling like a\\njoy.  We  must  have  at  least  one  thing  in  our  day-to-day  life\\nthat we are excited about, something to look forward to. Joy\\nwouldn\\'t  come  looking  for  you.  It\\'s  you  who  has  to  ﬁnd  it\\nand  if  you  cannot  ﬁnd  then  CREATE  the  sources  of  joy  in\\nyour life. There is a lot\\n\\nthat  you  will  have  to  do  to  survive,  and  to  get  ahead  in\\nlife.  Make  sure  you  do  something  every  day  so  joy  doesn\\'t\\nleave behind. Make your life joyful, not just bearable on the\\nmercy of weekends.\\n\\nAnd  I  know  it’s  easier  said  than  done  but  enough  of\\nmaking excuses for not trying something you always wanted\\nto. Your inner self has been waiting forever for you to catch\\nup  on  life  and  start  doing  things  that  matter  to  you.  You\\nhave waited enough for others and the world to bring joy to\\nyour  life,  now  it’s  your  turn  to  intentionally  create  a  joyful\\nlife. Not a happy life. But a joyful life. Happiness is a cheap\\nthing.  Joy  makes  life  rich.  And  the  good  thing  is,  you  can\\nalways ﬁnd at least one source of joy in your life if you look\\nfor it intentionally.\\n\\nBut why am I using the word intentionally repetitively?\\nBecause  it’s  easier  to  slip  back  to  your  default  setting\\nand blame the world for everything that goes wrong in your\\nlife. But when you take the responsibility in your hands, and\\nlook  for  something  to  ﬁll  your  day  with  JOY  with  complete\\nawareness,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  almost  everything  turns  into\\nfun  when  you  do  it  with  full  self-awareness.  It  could  be  as\\nsmall as the smell of your morning tea, the rays of sunshine\\n\\n\\x0ckissing  your  cheeks,  or  the  way  some  stranger  looked  at\\nyou. It’s in\\n\\nthe  small  moments  that  you  can  ﬁnd  joy  hidden  for  you\\nto ﬁnd it. Play with it. Joy is hidden playing hide-n-seek with\\nyou.  It’s  your  task  to  ﬁnd  it  somewhere  deep  inside  your\\nheart.\\n\\nTo give you an example from my life, I always hated my\\nhometown because it’s too small. My city is so small that it\\ndoesn’t have anything that I enjoy. We don’t have any park\\n(God, I love nature but duh..), no library (I am a book lover),\\nno  bookstore,  and  absolutely  no  art  galleries.  But  if  I  had\\nwaited  for  these  things  to  improve,  I  still  would  have  been\\nwaiting. So instead of playing the blame game or victimizing\\nmy  character,  I  choose  to  create  sources  of  joy  with  what  I\\nalready  had.  I  started  taking  evening  walks  in  the  narrow\\nstreets  of  my  city.  I  don’t  expect  much  from  my  evening\\nwalks.  I  just  expect  to  take  a  pause.  A  break  from  a  world\\nwhere  everyone  is  rushing  to  win  the  race  of  life.  These\\nevening walks allow me to renew my perception and look at\\nmy  own  city  with  awe.  Pay  attention  to  things  that  were\\ninvisible  to  my  eyes  before.  Find  a  little  piece  of  history  in\\nsome of the old houses and their mysterious doors. Look at\\nthe  same  faces  doing  the  same  monotonous  things  but\\nnotice something that may surprise me. That’s the reason I\\nchose  talking  walks  in  the  evening.  I  wanted  to  look  at\\npeople  and  observe  them  for  a  split  second  before  I\\nwandered  into  my  mind.  I  wanted  to  become  a  part  of\\nsomeone’s  life  secretly.  To  this  day,  my  evening  walks  are\\nsomething I look forward to, whether I am in my hometown\\nor  somewhere  else.  This \\nis  what  keeps  me  excited\\nthroughout  the  day,  especially  in  the  afternoon  when  I  feel\\ntired  and  sleepy.  I  feel  excited  to  take  a  pause  and  see\\nsomething  that  I  never  paid  attention  to.  It’s  so  small  and\\nprobably insigniﬁcant to most but it matters to me. It helps\\nme to unwind and take a break from worldly pressure.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd I strongly suggest you  try  to  ﬁnd  joy in  little  things.\\nMaybe  drink  your  morning  coﬀee  while  listening  to  your\\nfavorite  music  and  without  rushing  the  entire  process.\\nMaybe cook your food with a candle and romantic songs to\\naccompany you.\\n\\nYour  heart  already  knows  where  joy  lies  for  you.\\nFollow  your  heart’s  guidance  and  let  it  lead  you  to\\ncreate a joyful day-to-day life.\\n\\nThe  point  is  either  you  ﬁnd  joy  or  the  worry  ﬁnds\\n\\nyou.\\n\\n\\x0c2. Learn NEW Skills & Challenge\\n\\nYourself:\\n\\nI always wanted to learn swimming, calligraphy, and the\\nGerman  language.  And  there  are  endless  things  that  I  still\\nwant to learn. In fact, sometimes I feel this burning desire in\\nmy  heart  to  learn  new  things.  But  I  never  paid  much\\nattention  to  my  desire  for  learning  new  skills  because  a)\\nwho has the TIME and b) I….answer is loading\\n\\nI don’t know why we wait our entire life to try something\\nnew  or  feel  scared  to  learn  new  things.  We  somehow\\nmanage  to  waste  hours  on  social  media  but  it  becomes\\ntough  to  spare  15  minutes  every  day  to  dedicate  to  a  new\\nskill. We are living in a world where learning anything new is\\nas  easy  as  opening  YouTube  without  paying  a  single  buck.\\nAll the resources are available at our ﬁngertips for FREE yet\\nwe  ﬁnd  some  excuses  or  rather  lies  to  throw  at  our  own\\nfaces.\\n\\nHow very generous!!\\nI always wondered if I really want to learn all these things\\nthen  what  is  stopping  me?  I  waited  for  an  answer  just  to\\nrealize that I have been fooling myself all this time.\\n\\nWe all have time. Time is not the issue if you truly want\\nto  do  something.  The  issue  is  your  habit  of  making  silly\\nexcuses.  Not  even  excuses.  Your  habit  of  lying  to  yourself\\nwith perfection as if you will receive an award for it.\\n\\nIn  the  past  year,  I  have  learned  three  new  skills.  The\\nrecent one was something that I wanted to learn since I was\\n16.\\xa0   I  started  learning  ‘crocheting’  almost  a  few  months\\nback.  Now  that  I  know  it,  I  feel  super  excited  every  day  to\\nmake  something  new.  I  keep  watching  YouTube  videos  on\\nhow to crochet a bag or save cute crochet tops on Pinterest.\\nIt all feels exciting. I feel that I have a life beyond my work.\\nWith every new thing I make, I feel like I am growing. It feels\\nexciting to know that I am learning something that I always\\n\\n \\n\\x0cwanted  to.  I  feel  excited  to  know  that  this  can  turn  into\\nsomething  unexpected.  In  fact,  yesterday,  I  was  trying  to\\nsleep  but  all  I  could  think  of  was  trying  a  new  pattern  of\\ncrocheting so I got up and started crocheting.\\n\\nI understand that you might not have time to try or learn\\nnew  things.  But  then  you  can  take  at  least  15–20  minutes\\nevery day if you try not for anyone else but for YOURSELF.\\n\\nI  can  only  suggest  you  make  your  life  exciting.  Learn\\n\\nsomething new that you always wanted to. Maybe\\n\\nknitting or swimming or a new language. It will take time\\nto master a new skill but the process will ﬁll your day-to-day\\nlife with excitement. Your mind will be awake again. You will\\nstart  having  creative  ideas.  And  all  of  it  will  feel  like  a\\nperfect life. So, give it a try.\\n\\nMake  your  alone  time  addictive  by  learning  something,\\nand  doing  things  that  you  like.  Try  something  that  you\\nalways wanted to do. Ask yourself what you wanted to learn\\nbut you never gave your own interest enough attention. Is it\\ndancing? or learning a new language?\\n\\nWhatever it is, just focus on learning it.\\n\\nMake your alone time = your growth time.\\n\\n\\x0c3. Feed Your Brain with Knowledge:\\n\\nDo you know what’s the most pathetic lie told to us?\\nWe  are  manipulated  into  believing  that  studying  is\\nboring,  and  people  who  read  books  and  constantly  are  in\\nsearch of learning something new are ‘geeks.’ Most movies,\\nbooks, and series paint this idea in our brain that if you are\\nin your 20s, live wildly, get drunk, do stupid things, and blah\\nindustry  have\\nblah.  The  media  and  entertainment \\nsuccessfully  created  a  belief  in  our  minds  that  those  who\\nstudy hard in school/college are stupid weird kids who have\\nno means to enjoy life. This is happening intentionally. This\\nwhole  system  is  designed  carefully.  It’s  not  random  that\\nmost  people  prefer  to  get  drunk  on  weekends  instead  of\\nsitting  down  with  a  book  in  a  nice  park  or  library.  It’s  not\\nrandom. It’s designed to make us mentally weak so that we\\nstay a follower, not a leader.\\n\\nAnd to top it all, the education system in every country is\\ndesigned  in  such  a  way  that  we  are  bound  to  hate  books.\\nIsn\\'t it pathetic how every student is supposed to be good at\\nevery subject that some authorities chose for us years ago?\\nAnd  we  all  are  supposed  to  study  hard  and  prove  our\\nintelligence based on our scores in subjects that were forced\\non us? No wonder why people hate books.\\nBut do you know what’s the good thing?\\nThe good thing is you are not in school anymore (I hope)\\nand even if you are in school/college, you can still take the\\nresponsibility  to  feed  your  brain  with  the  knowledge  that\\nyou think is important to win big in real life. School and that\\nstrict system are over and as we discussed, you are on your\\nown. You can choose to read the books that make you\\nfeel excited and help you grow in life.\\n\\nWhen my college came to an end, I promised myself that\\nI  will  never  read  a  book  ever  again  in  my  life  until  I  am\\nforced  to.  I  simply  hated  books.  In  all  three  years  of  my\\n\\n \\n\\x0ccollege  life  and  countless  years  of  school,  I  never  found\\nanything worth applying in real life. My degree didn’t oﬀer a\\ngood job so what was the use? Ugh..books are boring. Why\\nwould anyone read them?\\n\\nOh wait, that\\'s old Renuka talking.\\nIn 2020 I read my ﬁrst book. Yes, during lockdown. I was\\nsuﬀering  from  extreme  frustration,  mental  breakdown,  and\\nvarious other personal and professional life problems. And it\\nwas  during  that  time,  I  read  my  ﬁrst  book  ‘The  Monk  Who\\nSold  His  Ferrari’  by  Robin  Sharma.  Not  only  did  this  book\\nhelp  me  see  everything  clearly,  but  it  also  made  me  fall  in\\nlove with\\n\\nbooks.  Since  then  I  have  read  more  than  200  books.\\nThere  was  a  time  when  I  was  addicted  to  books.  One  page\\nafter  another.  One  book  after  another.  Books  became  like\\ndrugs  to  me.  My  college  was  over.  I  didn’t  have  professors\\nor anyone else to guide me. And being an extremely under-\\nconﬁdent  person,  I  always  needed  someone  to  guide  me.\\nThat’s when books helped me. Whatever I needed help with,\\nI  would  start  reading  a  book  on  that  topic.  That’s  it.  Since\\nthen,  my  life  has  changed  in  ways  I  cannot  explain  to  you.\\nAnd as cliché as it may sound,\\n\\n“Books  are  powerful  and  words  hold  the  power  to\\n\\nchange your entire life”\\n\\nI have lived that quote. My life is the epitome of this one\\nquote.  Books  have  transformed  me.  Books  helped  me\\nunderstand myself and the world. Books helped me feed my\\nbrain  with  the  knowledge  and  wisdom  of  those  who  have\\nexperienced  more  than  me  in  life.  Books  helped  me  learn\\nfrom  the  mistakes  of  others  and  learn  to  be  kind  and\\nempathetic. Books made me smarter. Books fueled the air of\\nwisdom  in  me  and  with  every  exhale,  I  became  conﬁdent\\nand more successful in life.\\n\\nBooks  are  not  boring.  Books  are  magical.  They  hold  the\\npower to transform YOU into your dream version. And most\\nimportantly, books are our best friend. They don’t leave you\\n\\n\\x0clike people do. If you read a book, its knowledge is going to\\nbe with you forever and during the time of need, it will guide\\nyou.  That’s  what  you  expect  from  a  friend,  don’t  you?  You\\nwant your best friend to be honest with you. Well, books are\\nhonest  with  you.  They  show  you  the  mirror  while  helping\\nyou become better at the same time.\\n\\nDuring the times when I needed someone to guide me, I\\nfound  the  wisdom  of  books  to  guide  me  in  every  aspect  of\\nlife.\\n\\nStop  letting  the  media  fool  you.  Books  are  more\\ninteresting  than  you  can  imagine.  Read  books  of  every\\ngenre. If you want to learn to live a better life, read self-help\\nbooks.  If  you  want  to  learn  how  to  think  better,  read  great\\nphilosophers.  If  you  want  to  become  mentally  strong,  read\\nspiritual  books.  If  you  want  to  spice  up  your  life,  read\\nfantasy.  If  you  want  to  understand  humans,  read  ﬁction.\\nBooks  have  it  all.  Read  books  and  feed  your  brain.  In\\nyour free time, or what you call ‘alone time’, take out a book\\nand  read  at  least  5  pages.  Allow  yourself  to  drown  in  the\\npool  of  words.  Read  books  on  the  topics  that  pique  your\\ninterest.  Read  books  written  by  your  industry  expert  and\\nlearn  what  they  have  learned  after  spending  decades\\nworking. Read books written by people who inspire you and\\nmake yourself a tiny part of them by consuming their words.\\nEnough of excuses and drama. You have got so much to look\\nforward  to.  So  much  to  grow  and  learn.  And  books  are  the\\neasiest way to learn and grow in life.\\n\\nAnd not only books, dedicate yourself to learning. Make it\\nyour  goal  to  feed  your  brain  with  knowledge.  If  not  books\\nthen  go  ahead  and  listen  to  the  podcasts  and  speeches  by\\nyour favorite people. Listen to the TedTalk of the people who\\ninspire  you.  If  there  is  any  topic  that  piques  your\\ncuriosity,  don’t  let  it  die  a  slow  death  in  your  mind.\\nGet  up  and  search  about  that  topic  on  the  Internet.\\nGo  on  YouTube  or  Masterclass.  The  point  is  to  FEED\\nyour  brain  with  knowledge,  not  garbage.  You  don’t\\n\\n\\x0chave the time to complain about how people left you. There\\nis  so  much  out  there  that  you  need  to  learn.  There  are  so\\nmany topics and books that will make you feel a little more\\nalive. Dedicate your time to that.\\n\\n\\x0cFun Exercise:\\nTo  make  it  a  little  fun,  create  a  separate  folder  on  your\\nlaptop/mobile  or  buy  a  separate  notebook  for  everything\\nyou  learn  on  your  own.  Give  this  folder  or  notebook  the\\nname - ‘FEEDING MY MIND’\\n\\nAdd  every  little  thing  you  learn  in  this  notebook.  If  you\\nlisten  to  a  podcast/TedTalk,  add  the  summary  of  it,  even  if\\njust  the  bullet  points.  If  there  is  a  topic  that  you  would  like\\nto  search  about,  write  that  topic  and  schedule  a  date  with\\nyour brain and spend time learning about the topic/concept.\\nIf  you  read  a  book,  write  everything  you  learned  and\\neverything  you  would  want  to  implement  in  your  life.  If\\nthere  is  a  person  who  inspires  you,  create  a  proﬁle  of  that\\nperson in your notebook. Write the name of the person, add\\nhis/her picture, and then write everything you learned about\\nthis  person.  Let  this  notebook  or  separate  folder  be  the\\nsymbol  of  your  ﬁrst  step  toward  your  transformation.  Let\\nthis book deﬁne that you are ready to grow in life and build\\nyour best version.\\n\\nIn the end, I would say, Don’t let time slip from your\\nhands.  Educate  yourself,  train  yourself  and  most  of\\nall have fun with yourself.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 11 - Become Independent\\n\\nI  am  an  extremely  fun  and  imaginative  person.  And  I\\nhave a bad habit of leaving the sentences incomplete. What\\nI wanted to say was, I am an extremely fun and imaginative\\nperson  in  my  mind.  I  always  imagined  myself  having  FUN\\nwith  my  friends  especially  when  I  started  college.  I  guess  I\\nhave always been like this. As soon as I make new friends, I\\nwould  imagine  myself  enjoying  myself  with  them,  staying\\novernight,  watching  a  movie  together,  exploring  diﬀerent\\ncities,  and  all  that  stuﬀ  that  probably  makes  me  sound  too\\ndesperate.\\n\\nI remember, when I started college, I had imagined that I\\nwould  be  meeting  some  amazing  friends  and  we  would  go\\nout to explore this new city every weekend or maybe we will\\nbecome a part of the same NGO and other tit-bits from what\\nI  had  learned  from  movies.  But  college  was  exactly  the\\nopposite. For the ﬁrst few weeks, I wasn’t even able to say\\n‘hello’ to anyone without looking at my shoes because I was\\ntoo  shy  and  underconﬁdent.  And  when  I  made  friends,  we\\nused to stay in our rooms all the time because none of them\\never  wanted  to  go  out  and  try  anything  new.  Something\\nsimilar happened when I came home after college. I thought\\nI had time to build my career and once I do that, I will travel\\nto all the popular cities of my\\n\\ncountry, stay there for a few weeks and make some nice\\nfriends for a lifetime. I built my career and started traveling\\nwhich ended by covering just two cities. Do you know why?\\nBecause  the  reality  wasn’t  as  amazing  as  I  had  fantasized\\nabout it.\\n\\nThough what I realized from my experience is that at all\\ntimes we expect to have fun with other people. We imagine\\nhow we will go out for a party with our friends and how we\\nwill go on a dinner date with our partner and how we will go\\n\\n \\n\\x0cfor  a  picnic  with  our  family  and  a  few  occasional  brunch\\ndates with our best friend.\\n\\nThe  problem  emerges  when  our  fascinating  imagination\\ndoesn’t  match  our  reality.  When  people  forget  their  brunch\\nwith  you  or  cannot  make  time  from  their  busy  schedule  to\\ngo  partying  with  you  or  if  they  don’t  like  to  do  the  same\\nthings  for  fun  as  you  do.  And  other  people  are  not  to  be\\nblamed for this. Obviously, they cannot function as per your\\ndesires  or  mood.  They  have  got  a  life  too.  It’s  not\\nanyone’s job to satisfy your desires or manifest your\\nimagination into reality.\\n\\nBut the desire is there in your heart and someone should\\npay  attention  to  it.  And  that  someone  should  be  YOU.  You\\ncannot  bury  your  desires  in  your  heart  just  because  others\\ndidn’t acknowledge them.\\n\\nThis  chapter  is  the  shortest  one  because  what  I  want  to\\ntell you is a simple truth about adulthood and how you can\\nhave fun with yourself. Also, this is the last chapter because\\nwhat you will learn in this chapter is probably the last thing\\nyou will need to ﬁnd happiness on your own. The one thing\\nthat I want you to take with you from this book and the one\\nthing that has helped me over the years is this,\\n\\n“Do the things that you wanted to do with others”\\nI always wanted to do one of those sleepovers where all\\nfriends  come  over,  we  light  some  candles,  create  a  good\\nenvironment and arrange comforting food, and watch one of\\nour  favorite  movies.  I  used  to  see  this  in  movies  and  I\\nimagined  it  would  be  fun  to  do  this  with  my  friends.  But\\nafter  college,  you  don’t  get  to  do  these  things.  Everyone\\nbecomes  an  adult  with  baggage  of  responsibilities.  And\\nthese little things stop making sense. No one would want to\\nwaste their time doing it. So, I ﬁgured, so what if my friends\\ncannot come? I can do this for myself. Whenever I feel super\\nburned  out  with  my  work  or  general  life  worries,  I  dim  the\\nlights,  light  a  candle,  order  pasta,  make  iced  coﬀee  and\\nwatch a Christmas movie. I am telling you it feels heavenly. I\\n\\n\\x0chonestly feel like I am no longer a part of the world, at least\\nfor a few hours.\\n\\nI \\n\\nfulﬁlled  that  desire. \\n\\nThe  bottom  line  was  I  had  a  desire  to  do  a  complete\\nmovie  setup.  And \\nI  became\\nindependent of my needs. I hold myself accountable for my\\nimagination. Not anyone else. If I had waited for my friends\\nto  appear,  I  would  have  still  been  waiting.  Besides,  not\\neveryone has the luxury to work from anywhere at any time.\\nI have and I understand that my friends don’t.\\n\\nSimilarly,  I  always  liked  the  idea  of  a  picnic.  So,  once\\nevery month, I travel around 40 minutes to get to this place\\nwhere there is a huge open ground. I go there with my book\\n(or  Kindle),  and  I  take  my  journal  as  well  as  my  crocheting\\nstuﬀ.  I  also  pack  something  to  eat.  Mostly,  I  take  my  iced\\ncoﬀee  and  a  doughnut.  And  do  I  need  to  mention  how\\namazing  that  feels?  It  feels  like  real  self-care.  I  do  the\\nthings that I desire with myself.\\n\\nAnd  if  I  was  your  mother,  I  would  push  you  out  of  the\\ndoor  to  go  and  do  everything  that  you  always  wanted  but\\nnever  did  because  you  didn’t  have  an  army  of  people  to\\naccompany you.\\n\\nIt’s  been  a  long  time  since  you  are  waiting  for  others  to\\nunderstand your desires and then turn them into reality. It’s\\ntime you do everything that you desire with yourself. Plan a\\ndinner date with yourself at the end or start of every month.\\nTake  yourself  for  a  coﬀee  date.  Click  pretty  pictures  of\\nyourself.  Talk  to  yourself  about  how  your  day  went  or  what\\nyou did in your day or maybe how you would like to start the\\nnext  day.  Give  your  room  a  makeover  or  write  a  love  letter\\nto  yourself  that  you  wanted  to  receive  from  others.  Buy\\nyourself  a  ﬂower  or  better  buy  a  mini  plant  so  it  always\\nreminds  you  that  ‘you  have  got  your  back.’  Gift  yourself\\nsomething  special  every  time  you  accomplish  a  big  goal,\\npraise yourself, and say it out aloud, ‘I am proud of myself.’\\n\\n\\x0cTask:  If  possible,  write  an  ‘I  missed  myself’  letter  to\\nyourself. I know it sounds kind of weird but try it. Write down\\nhow  you  have  been  missing  yourself.  Write  how  you  have\\nbeen  ignorant  towards  yourself  and  why  you  will  never\\nrepeat this mistake. Write how you never did everything you\\never  wanted  and  how  you  will  do  everything  you  always\\nwanted to from now on.\\n\\nWhatever  you  plan  to  do,  whether  it  is  buying  yourself\\nﬂowers or coﬀee, do it intentionally and do it romantically. If\\nyou  decide  to  go  on  a  dinner  date  with  yourself.  Take  the\\neﬀort to look good and put on your favorite dress.\\n\\n“Romanticize  the  actions  that  you  take  for\\nyourself.  Acknowledge  your  desires  and  turn  them\\ninto  something  better  than  your  imagination.  It’s  all\\nabout making an eﬀort for yourself.”\\n\\n\\x0cBecause guess what? The world is like a big dinner party\\nwhere  you  are  supposed  to  serve  yourself.  If  you  expect\\npeople  to  ﬁrst  put  your  desired  dish  on  your  plate,  you  will\\nbe  starved.  You  wouldn’t  get  to  taste  what’s  out  there.\\nEveryone  is  busy  serving  themselves  with  what  they  think\\nthey  want  to  taste.  Take  this  book  as  a  sign  to  see  what’s\\navailable out there, what you would like to explore, and then\\ngo get it yourself. Because as I said, you are on your own.\\n\\n\\x0cI  am  Renuka  Gavrani. \\n\\nAbout the Author\\nlike  to  write  about  my\\nI \\nexperiences  and  observations  in  life.

      "a document is a piece of text and Associated metadata for example a text file CSV YouTube video web page file directory or even a PDF and see we can use something called a document loader to upload these documents to utilize them within our large language models and why I gave all those examples I'm going to be showing you guys how to load each of these specific types of documents in this video with the help of some basic python code if you're brand new here to this YouTube channel I am building out a Series this year based around Lang chain large language models and open AI API now you don't need a ton of background information to understand all the code that is going on this video but if you want to go over some of the basics I have the playlist linked on my Channel with that being said I'm going to be coding all this in Google collab feel free to use whatever code editor that you would like and let's start coding all right so my Google collab notebook let's get going uh what we're going to have to do is actually pip install quite a lot of things so pip install we're going to put our YouTube transcript API in here and that's going to be a fun video in the future but I'll show you guys how we can uh load in our YouTube videos then pip install unstructured okay then up next pip install Pi PDF and then P install Lan chain I think that's the last one I'll just look at my source code yeah so I'm going to run these few lines real quick it'll probably take a minute or two and then we'll Flash Forward once that's done all right so let's start off with doing a normal text document so what we're going to do is from Lang chain Community then we're going to say document loaders which you can find most of this information from so I'm pretty much following the tutorials that are posted on there but tweaking it up a little bit for these videos um so here we go from Lang chain Community document loaders Import in text loader we'll run that over here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab in some music lyrics so one of my favorite metal bands is a band called opth I just randomly searched opth lyrics they had this website Dark lyrics sounds kind of spooky some of the opth songs are um but I just went over here and essentially grabbed lyrics to a song threw it into a text file so and I grabbed I believe I grabbed Blackwater perk which is one of my favorite albums of all time regardless uh so let me load that up over here so in Google collab you can just click this folder over here and then you can drag in what you want so let me just drag this in really quick and then it gives you this warning or runtime files will be deleted when this runtime is terminated so anytime you rerun this you'll have to re-upload your files over here it's not a a big deal but it can be a little bit annoying sometimes a video like this where we have a lot of different file formats it's a little annoying but not a big deal again all right so that's in there so all we have to do now is say loader equals text loader like this and then put the file that you want in here now I'm going to bring an op. text like that so run that and we have our opth file in here now the other lines of code again this is a pretty basic tutorial but we can just do doc equals our loader. load like this okay now we have our Doc in here and just to show you what this looks like you can just put dock over here and here we go we have the lyrics for opth song and it's broken down by each line too so just a few lines and we loaded in our text document and uh if you print this out at least in Google collab it all prints out essentially in one line so that's why I kind of just showed doc like that that way you can see it all and at the very end metadata source and then just says opth do text great now let's take a look at how we can bring in a CSV document so I already prepped the CSV document it's it's not perfect by any means but it's for the tutorial so I'm grabbing some past ultra marathon results so ver Beach Ultra my last 50 mile that I ran which one the toughest races yet but they have results on here so I just grabbed those specific results um 2023 right we go over here to the 50 mile and I feel pretty badly at this race but I was getting back into Ultras again and here we go so let's bring in that CSV so what I can do is say from Lang chain community. documents _ loaders CSV loader import CSV loader and like you don't need to put the results in you could literally just grab whatever CSV you want or even already have on your computer and just throw that in so again we'll uh grab this CSV really quick and um throw that over here and let's grab that so now what we're going to do is loader equals CSV loader then put our file path in here equals and then what I like to do is kind of shortcut sometimes is just go over here and just say copy path and then you don't need this slash content in here for Google collab to understand what's going on you a loader in here and then again uh let's set up our data so data equals loader. load like this and that and then if we wanted to print data again I'm just going to print it out data like that and we have our data that's been printed out over here right so ranking names different things like that all across the way uh but there's a few parameters that you could actually just throw in with the CSV document loader so I just want to show you a few of those really quick if it does interest you if not feel free to skip ahead um but I'll just copy the same thing over here again so so loader equals CSV loader file path again perfectly fine as it is right now you can also set up a source column so Source column argument this is what it says on the in the link chain docs it says use the source column argument to specify a source for the document created from HL otherwise the file path will be used as the source for all documents created from the CSV file so you can do that you could also put in some arguments so just to show you how this kind of works we can say Source call equals and let's just say you put your place like the ranking in a specific race right and then we can set up our CSV args so CSV args like this open that up in here first thing you can do is you can set your specific delimiter so delimiter now this CSV that I use is just a comma that splits it so that's pretty basic over there uh another thing that you can can do is set up your field names the field names and then I'm not going to type all these out but I'm just going to copy and paste this what I already had and essentially just put all those different fields in there and you should be good to go try to see really quick why I have an error over here was not closed I close it let's see I forget a comma loader equal CSV loader file path Source column Place CSV args where is my weird either I'm blind or I don't see it I'm just G to copy over my code oh I didn't put the equals sign that makes a lot of sense make sure you put equal sign there and uh boom there we go same thing data equals loader. load right and then if we want to print our data out here we go so page content you'll see first name last name everything like that we'll keep going through State metadata and then we have our source over here and this time for the source it changed into place and it says row Z where as above if we go over here to our source you can see Source 2023 v50 CSV row zero right so feel free to change this as you want add in parameters but all right so now what we're going to do is take a look specifically at a directory loader so what we can do is from L chain Community like this once again document loaders we're going to import in our directory load and what's cool directory loader is you can Import in multiple files at a time so directory loader like that and um you will have to specify what type of format that is but let's go through this uh so let's start off with our text document so we'll do loader equals directory loader like that uh first parameter over here you have to see where your directory is in Google collab it's just going to be pretty much this right U blank no space on here single quotes then we're going to put Globe like this say equals and um we're going to put on this side I things star star and then put your file format so I'm going to put txt we're going to load our text document first and then you have an option also to put if you want to use multi-threading so use multithreading I'm going just going to put it equal to true because technically it's not using my computer it's using um what Google CL uses in the back so we'll run that over here awesome and then what we can do is set docs equal to loader. load like this and run that super fast and you can just put over here length of the docs and we should get one back and we get one awesome now let's take a look at a CSV file so our CSV file is going to be this Viro but what I will say with Google collab we have sample data we have one two three four so some of these might get picked up so it'll either be one of those so let's change this up the CSV over here and we'll rerun this we'll rerun that looks like we are getting two errors loading file the emus test and train wonder if it's going to populate these other two see and then if we go to link docs we should get three this time if there worked properly and we did so if you want to see also what this looks like we can just go over here docks and uh yeah it's uh it's going to take up a lot of the screen so I am just gonna pretend I didn't type that out and we're just going to delete that and keep moving forward so all right so we're going to look at YouTube now just real quick though I did have to install itbe so make sure you pip install that before you start coding otherwise you are going to get an error so I do apologize for not putting that in the beginning uh YouTube's honestly pretty easy to do so what we're going to start off with is from linkchain Community once again. document loaders you're going to get tired of this by the end of the video but Import in our YouTube loader and then and just run that and am I getting an error probably because I had a typo capital T no capital T I'm so used to putting a capital T that should be fixed because I'm pretty sure YouTube has a capital T all right not to go on a tangent or anything like that um all we're going to set this up is loader equals YouTube no Capital YouTube loader from YouTube url then you want to grab in the link to your video um I'm just going to grab in this one right over here so your 9in nails fan awesome if not whatever uh you're missing off on some good music but we'll throw that in over here for our YouTube YouTube url then what I'm going to do next is we're going to add in video info so add video info we can set that equal to true and what's pretty cool and I I'll cover this in another video got to make a capital there um we'll cover this in another video but essentially we can do is set up transcripts so you can also convert your videos to another language so you can just say like language equals and first put the language at the videos in right and then you want to translate it you can do that also I don't need to put the language in Translation here because I believe it's English by default but you can put that in here if you want to but just to show you guys some of the other parameters and um you just want to set up your loader like that I'm not going to load in the YouTube video but essentially that's what you would have to do we'll cover this in another video I promise you and it'll be a pretty fun project um let's go into our HTML loader now and there's actually two different HTML loaders out there so um use which one you want I'm just going to go over those really quick so you can see HTML we have an unstructured and then we have one that also uses beautiful soup I'm just going to use the one that uses beautiful soup for this video These are both kind of similar uh the other differences right so it says beautiful soup we can use load over here this will distract the text from HTML into a page content a page title into the metadata this cover all load HTML documents into a document format that we can use Downstream so just use beautiful soup because I've used it for scraping before which would be kind of fun I could make some scraping videos in the future but uh not to go on a tangent or anything like that from L chain community that document loaders loaders like that import the S HTML loader like that onun that over here and then we're going have to put loader equals we'll put this b bs HTML loader and then you're going to have to put an HTML file in here um I'm just going to grab the HTML file from my own website so not my coding website which I still need to do that but my uh sports card website so breakout cards. HML and just to show you guys like I haven't worked on this a lot recently but I definitely need to in the future but this is my website for sports cards so up coping card shows I stopped that a long time ago that you can tell like last time I've updated this website it's been quite a while but regardless as my website on here been focusing a lot more on the coding side um but I have my breakout cards HTML so we can just rename this file if we wanted to or just copy it right copy that throw it in here oh and I forgot to show you all you want to save website HTML you just right click over here you can click save as and um you can just do webpage. HTML obviously don't have this name over here but like Lang chain. HTML if you really want to I'm not going to save it but uh that's what you could specifically do all right uh back over here just showed you how you can download the HTML we have our loader just run the loader and then like the rest of this video data equals loader. [Music] load and um be a lot of data so I'm just show you data again all populates over here don't really need it so delete because I'd rather have this a little bit cleaner but that's how you would do that and lastly let's take a look at a PDF so we're going to go from Lane chain we need document loaders we'll just copy this one and this time what we're going to do is put over here Pi PDF loader like that run that over here loader equals Pi PDF loader we'll grab that throw it over here now you need your PDF file um we'll just throw this in over here so I collect a lot of foreign issues this is kind of like a magazine from overseas Card World so just show you guys what this looks like really quick you can just tell how much I'm uner in this video but like we're talking about foreign nons sports cards so and some prices and stuff like that regardless right just my first first PDF I found I using it for this video okay so throw that in over here or just copy that path paste that over here delete that so now we have our loader like that then we can just say like Pages this time or data use whatever want right I'll but I'm just going to say loader. load and splits like that and what's cool is we can actually grab specific Pages now from the PDF and now if you want to see a specific page you just go over here to pages and just put a number in here so let's say like we wanted to see the first page which is Page zero populates that right Card World March April 2023 low resolution PDF we go back over here right page zero and um can change this as you want right so go back if we put like Pages gra 11 and then put that over here you can see a page 11 is there's a lot of pages in this PDF so I'm not going to go through that all but you kind of understand how the basics work so just to kind of like rate what we covered in this video essentially go to Lang chain Community document loaders or whatever document that you want to load up and showed you how you can do most of these out here there's also like Json a few other file formats I did not specifically cover mark down as well so import that in make sure you pip install any packages that you need for that specific loader then throw in the file over here or you could use your directory and just grab that just depends on your file format on that side of things and each uh docum is a little bit different but for the PDF one we can grab Pages other ones you can just grab everything at hey you made it to the end of this video well congrats you learned about document loaders I'm going to be expanding on these in future videos as well as a project so make sure to stay tuned for that by subscribing to the channel it's 100% for free and it also shows YouTube that people enjoy the videos that I am developing now if you want to check out my full playlist of AI videos I have them right over here\n"

Pasta & wonton were good but pizza was way to sweet. Upon confronting the staff their response was slow & made faces. They responded that we use ready-made sauces so it would taste sweet only in a rude way & didn't mention it at the time of placing the order. We do understand that servers are not responsible for taste of food but they should respond properly.\n",

The menu is very similar to many other places. the food choice is EXTREMELY POOR. THE BEVERAGE MENU HAS MORE OPTIONS THAN THE FOOD MENU.  THE PLACE IS really small and the seating system is really bad too, they made us sit on a two person table when we were 3 of us and refused to give us a 4 person table and we sat pretty uncomfortably. Also the rates are very expensive just because of its location. The taste of food is also very basic and average.

The berry frappe was worth 350 rs. And consisted of churned milk with vanilla ice cream and strawberry syrup with whipped cream on the top. I think regular shakes available in local joints tastes better than this. It was uber sweet and had no 'berry' whatsoever. Poor attempt at such a renowned hotel! The danish pastry was another disappointment. Topped with what seemed like stale mango shrikhand and cubes of stale mango, it was another bad outcome.

The Blt sandwich had one piece of bacon and one piece of mini tomato and that’s it just bread…last time we also faced the same issue with the quality inspite of complaining they haven’t taken any action and argue with us that everything is right. We have been regular here for almost 12 years so it’s really dreadful experience…we will now discontinue going to this place and pass on this to our family friends as well.

All were great and the portion size was also generous. Also ordered a frappe with caramel addition.

I would not suggest any fried products as it seems like they're frozen and it ends up tasting really weird.pepperoni pizza - nice crust, decent tasting pizza, pretty standard and i think any pizza might be a good choice as it seems to be their specialty lemon ginger beer- refreshing summery drink, heavier on the ginger flavour so if you don't like that then you might not enjoy it.request to the restaurant- please improve your fish fingers, it was really disappointing :(\n",

The place is clean and classy and has decent enough space and good lighting. The location too is cozy. We’ve had the hot chocolate which is the best I’ve had! The Vietnamese coffee which is amazing, croissants are lovely and full, the sandwiches with the focaccia bread were bomb too. Will continue to visit Nadora, especially for the Hot chocolate.

      "Review: Very good ambience and vibe. Menu is decent. The variety seems a little narrow spectrum in general but worked for me, maybe won't for someone with a lesser wide palate.The coffee was good. However it didn't match half it's look in terms of taste. I knew what I'm ordering, I knew what the standard dish would have but the server on confirmation couldn't explain. He kept saying it will have cream whipped cream of some kind but it won't be cream also. Not how it works. You can't trust someone with your food when they don't know what it is.Breakfast dishes tasted decent. Avocado toast was borderline average. Shakshuka was 5/5 for sure. 💯 Tiramisu iced latte was a great great iced coffee...read more\n",

The gnocchi pesto pasta was disappointing, with the gnocchi resembling mush and lacking any texture. Our order of ratatouille was more akin to mixed vegetables, rather than the traditional dish. Thankfully, the drinks were nice, providing a solitary redeeming factor. A mix-up occurred where our gnocchi pasta was initially delivered to the wrong table, then subsequently brought to us. This was an unacceptable mistake. Overall, Farmhouse used to be a quality restaurant, but its standards have evidently declined. Sadly, I don't see it making a comeback. It's done.\n",

I wanted to try out their burgers so I went for a howlin Woolf burger and a cheesy chicken burger. I really liked the quality of ingredients used. The burger tasted really good and it was extremely filling. For starters I tried the peri peri chicken wings which was pretty average. The ambiance is simple and nothing very catchy about it. But if you’re looking for a quiet place for lunch/dinner plans this should be a good choice.\n",

They have outdoor and indoor seating with tables and chairs outside and sofa chairs inside. The sofa chairs are very pretty with good cushioning which makes seating comfortable. There are plastic vibes and pink flowers adorning the ceiling and windows. The glass display has pastries, cheesecake, croissants, etc. The menu has ice coffee, cold coffee, frappe, milkshakes, hot coffee, etc. The food menu includes starters like bruschetta, bagels, sandwiches, etc and mains like pizza, pasta. We ordered tiramisu latte and classic cold coffee and both were good, with right sweetness and consistency....read more\n",

The food service is quick. Scan the QR code and order through the phone. Ordered brownie shake which was thick and tasted good , cosmo tasted perfect as it should , the nachos were loaded with cheese and the pizza was actual cheese burst with a sweeter sauce in base .

      "Review: Let me start by telling everyone that im a pizza lover. I really wanted to try this place out because its reviews were really good but it was quite expensive so waited for the right time.I would say it wasn’t up to the mark as what I expected. The sauce on the pizza was negligible and the cheese I personally didnt like . The vegetables were great as they weren’t chewy and melted just after biting them. The crust was thin, crispy and light which was tasty. BUT the overall combination of the pizza didnt justify the worth (1200/-)nor the taste.The pasta was tasty but the bread that came with it was chewy as hell i would so INEDIBLE .\n",

The Amazon pockets were good.Aglio oglio was the safest last choice and ended up being the biggest disappointment for the price point and quantity which was falling throughout.In desserts, chocolate truffle was good and cupcake was below par. Orange juice and lemon iced tea were good.Portion size for all food items was quite small.Wouldn't recommend.\n",

Though it tasted nice but it wasn't what we ordered. Rest of the food tasted nice. Khatta Teekha Limbu is not for everyone so only order if you like too much khatta drinks. Strawberry mojito was pleasant to the taste.Overall a good experience and we would surely come again.\n",

Located between Sikar Road and Vidhyadhar Nagar, the outlet is decent and safe place to hangout alone, with friends, partner or even family. The ambience is very peaceful and decent. The bar of this restaurant is located in its basement which makes this restaurant quiet family-friendly too. Coming to the food: it's fresh, delicious, reasonably priced and with good quantity. I have tried Veg Chwomein, Biryani, Tangri Kebab, Hot Cafe Latte and Chicken Lollypop till now. Each of the items were well-prepared and delicious. I found no problem in consuming aby of the items.

      "Review: Good interiors, great place to have a converstion over coffee. Variety of food and drink options are available on the menu. Taste-wise, seasoning was a hit and miss in the dishes. We ordered the spinach soup (florantine) and Al Fredo pasta with mushrooms. The soup was not as hot as expected, with a slightly skewed proportion of salt-pepper. Basically, namak was not swad anusar. The pasta on the other hand was much better, the saving grace being the mushrooms which we added to the Al fredo. I’m not sure how it would have tasted without the well-seasoned mushrooms. We also ordered coffee which almost get like a dessert so that might be a tad disappointing for hard core coffee lovers....read more\n",

While the food is ridiculously overpriced for its underwhelming food, perhaps the biggest problem they must overcome is their pathetic service. The staff are not only slow, but also disrespectful and rude, so much that it may feel like you’re eating there for free. If you’re lucky, you may receive service from one of the friendly staff which are very less in number, of course. I’ve been here a dozen times in the recent past, hoping to find at least one good thing to return to. I wouldn’t recommend this place anymore for any reason, other than if...read more\n",

I was looking out places to host my pet’s first bday and my friend suggested Scooby’s cafe since it was compact place with outdoor seating. After a lot of discussions with the cafe owner Sharmila , I reserved this place. I was skeptical about the food since I had gone through the reviews so I did not commit. Welcome drink was complimentary and I was glad it all worked in my budget. Sharmila was very accommodative to all my requests. Damn sweet :) So the D- day came , I was surprised with the cute decors.
